## L21 (NEW candidate — origin 2026-06-04 PM user articulation + same-day market action confirmation)

**Origin:** 2026-06-04 PM user articulation post-AVGO Q2 print resolution: *"the growth numbers are really good, but the expectations from the streets was, like, even higher. So that's why you can now see a lot of the AI companies coming down today... it's down double digits. After that, I assume it's just people and retail, especially, and investors were just looking for more... even higher expectations even though they printed some really good numbers."*

Same-day market action confirmed sector-wide pattern per [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-leads-semiconductor-selloff-after-openai-misses-user-goals-93CH-4641184) + [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4569429-semiconductor-and-ai-software-stocks-see-red-amid-tech-stock-selloff):
- April CPI 3.8% YoY vs 3.7% expected = killed 2026 Fed cut hopes
- QCOM -10%, Micron -5%+, MRVL -4%, NVDA traded $221.79
- Broad AI semi selloff, not AVGO-specific

Pattern confirmed independently via [Investing.com AI valuation reality check](https://www.investing.com/analysis/ai-stocks-lose-altitude-as-earnings-reset-forces-a-valuation-reality-check-200674459) and [Motley Fool "Saaspocalypse"](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/18/the-2026-software-stock-sell-off-ai-disruption-fea/): 2026 has been the "AI sector earnings reset" year — beats can't satisfy because expectations were aggressive going in.

**Pattern:** When sector-wide macro news (CPI, rates, geopolitical) triggers risk-off, Stage 4 AI names with crowded sentiment default to NEGATIVE reaction on BEAT + CATEGORY. The COHORT regime overrides the idiosyncratic signal. Only surprise INPUT (corporate event, M&A, hidden disclosure) or earlier-stage names escape.

**Regime-overlay framework (candidate, my model):**

| Stage | Pre-print rally | Framing | Macro context | Default reaction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stage 2-3 | any | any | any | POSITIVE on beat (room to re-rate) |
| Stage 4 | <8% | FY raise explicit | risk-on | POSITIVE on beat |
| Stage 4 | <8% | multi-year only | risk-on | NEUTRAL on beat |
| Stage 4 | >10% | FY raise explicit | risk-on | NEUTRAL on beat |
| Stage 4 | >10% | multi-year only | risk-on | NEGATIVE on beat |
| Stage 4 | >10% | multi-year only | **risk-off** | **STRONG NEGATIVE** (AVGO Q2 case) |
| Stage 4 | any | surprise INPUT (M&A, corporate event) | any | OVERRIDE — POSITIVE on beat |

**Generalizable lesson:** For all future predictions in 2026 H2, add a sector-regime check as the FIRST modifier before applying L14:
1. Is the sector in regime-default-NEGATIVE state? (Stage 4 + crowded + macro risk-off)
2. Is there a regime escape condition? (Stage 2-3 OR surprise INPUT)
3. Reaction prediction = L14 default × regime modifier

**Layer failed (retrospective on AVGO Q2):** REASONING — applied L14 + L14-v2 + L19 (multi-year framing) + L20 (macro confound) AS INDEPENDENT modifiers. Actually they are SECTOR REGIME conditions that COMPOUND multiplicatively, not additively. Sector regime is the higher-level frame.

**Calibration adjustment:** L14 framework is now nested inside a sector-regime check. Default base rate of POSITIVE reaction on BEAT+CATEGORY is no longer 70-80% for Stage 4 AI names — it's ~40-50% (my model) given 2026 regime. Falsifiable via Q3 FY26 earnings season (NVDA Q2 FY27 in August will be the load-bearing test).

**Falsification trigger:** If NVDA Q2 FY27 (August 2026) beats expectations cleanly with FY raise + macro-neutral environment AND stock goes >+10%, L21 regime is intact. If beat + FY raise produces 0% or negative reaction, regime is more severe than modeled.

**Re-eval trigger:** monthly codification audit 2026-06-24 + next Stage 4 AI earnings print (Marvell, OKLO, ANET, NVDA).

## L22 (NEW candidate — origin 2026-06-04 PM user articulation + Murata test case)

**Origin:** 2026-06-04 PM user articulation in response to my anchored-on-rally trim recommendation: *"If I would be capable, I would use alternative data sources, direct data sources to... look at the previous earnings, and then map out the previous earnings already reflect the tailwind that Murata gets from Agentic AI and the increase of MLCC, and also the Edge AI tailwind that now is coming from Computex when it comes to, uh, laptops being AI CPU native. And if that is the case, if it's already reflecting, then, of course, I think it's worthwhile trimming. If the reflection hasn't really transitioned or translated into financials yet, as in, for example, their price increase, that means they can still beat the expectations that investors have."*

**Pattern:** Rally-based trim decisions without checking the tailwind-vs-financial-reflection gap = anti-bottoms-up (Principle #1 violation). The right test before any rally-based trim is: are the structural tailwinds already in the FINANCIALS / GUIDANCE the analysts are modeling?

**Refinement on user's framework (mine):** The TRUER test is "does the company BEAT ANALYST CONSENSUS" (not "does it beat its own guide"). Reason: stock price already absorbs analysts' uplift above company guide. Analyst consensus is the bar the market actually measures against.

**Generalizable lesson:** Before any rally-based trim decision on a held name, run the 4-step test:
1. What is the company's own guide for next print?
2. What is analyst consensus for next print?
3. What's the gap (analyst consensus above guide = analysts already expect beat)?
4. What post-guidance accelerators exist that haven't been priced into consensus YET?

If post-guidance accelerators add MORE upside than the analyst-consensus-above-guide gap → BEAT likely → HOLD
If analyst consensus already absorbs the accelerators → MEET likely → tighter call, consider trim
If post-guidance HEADWINDS exist that haven't been priced → MISS risk → trim candidate

**Layer it operates at:** This is at the COMPUTATION layer of GRADE (mapping signal flow from guidance → consensus → stock). Combined with L21 (sector regime modifier) at the REASONING layer.

**Calibration adjustment:** Rally magnitude alone CANNOT trigger trim. The bottoms-up tailwind-vs-consensus-gap check is the gate. Otherwise = Principle #1 violation.

**Validation case N=1 (Murata 2026-06-04):**
- Murata FY27 guide: ¥380B OP / ¥295B NP / ¥1.96T rev
- Analyst FY27 consensus: ¥422.378B recurring profit (= +8.3% above guide)
- Post-guidance accelerators: Anthropic 5GW + AVGO Q3 $16B + Gemma 4 12B edge + Goldman pricing-power-exceeds-expectations + MLCC cycle 2030 extension
- Gap analysis: post-guidance accelerators ADD meaningful upside beyond consensus uplift
- Conclusion: HOLD, do NOT trim despite +69% rally from BEP

**Falsification trigger:** If Q1 FY27 Murata print (late July / early August 2026) MEETS consensus exactly OR MISSES, L22 framework was over-bullish on post-guidance accelerator translation. If BEATS, L22 validated as the right test (replaces rally-magnitude as primary).

**Re-eval trigger:** Q1 FY27 Murata print + monthly codification audit 2026-06-24.

## L23 (NEW candidate — origin 2026-06-04 PM user articulation + N=4 same-direction confirmation)

**Origin:** 2026-06-04 PM user articulation in the SYNA DEEP-DIG context: *"if the company is small and they would have brought out the same numbers as Broadcom did yesterday, I would assume, and that's an unverified assumption, that that company probably would be up ten to twenty percent today. Because it was already in the air, and now it's [AVGO] able... it's already a two trillion dollar company. The expectations are set even higher."*

**Pattern (verified N=4 across recent earnings cohort):**
- AVGO Q2 FY26 (~$2T mcap, Stage 4): BEAT + CATEGORY (Anthropic 5GW + Google TPU multi-gen + Q3 +200%) → -3 to -13.78%
- HPE Q2 FY26 (~$24B mcap, Stage 2-3): BEAT + CATEGORY (FY27 framework + H3C surprise) → +29 to +36%
- SNOW Q1 FY27 (~$70B mcap, Stage 3): BEAT + RAISE + $6B AWS pact → +25%
- MRVL Q1 FY27 (~$80B mcap, Stage 3-4): BEAT + FY28 NEW guide → -1.96% pre-market

**Same earnings disclosure (BEAT + CATEGORY) produces INVERSE stock reactions:**
- Stage 2-3 mid-cap → +25 to +36%
- Stage 3 mid-cap → +20 to +25%
- Stage 3-4 mid-cap → -2 to +5%
- Stage 4 mega-cap → -3 to -15%

**Generalizable lesson:** Disclosure quality is NOT the dispositive variable for stock reaction — the EXPECTATIONS GAP relative to market cap and Stage is. Mega-cap absorbs strong disclosure into flat-to-negative; mid-cap rerates aggressively on same signal because expectations are NOT priced.

**Implication for PREDICT workflow:**
For Stage 2-3 mid-cap names (SYNA, AMBA, LSCC, smaller edge-AI), expected reaction band on BEAT + CATEGORY = +15 to +35% even at modest beat magnitude IF call commentary delivers any of:
- Explicit forward AI revenue % target
- Named customer disclosure (Tier-1 hyperscaler/OEM/wearable)
- Multi-year framing with quantification
- Margin trajectory commentary
- Backlog / visibility specifics

The CALL-COMMENTARY-LEVEL variables matter more than headline beat magnitude at mid-cap.

**Combined with L19 (multi-year framing) inversion:**
- At Stage 4 mega-cap: multi-year framing = NEGATIVE reaction (expectations wanted current-FY raise)
- At Stage 2-3 mid-cap: multi-year framing = POSITIVE reaction (new visibility = new narrative)

**Combined with L20 (macro confounder):**
- In risk-off regime: same call disclosure produces +5-15% mid-cap reaction (50% discount)
- In neutral macro: +15-25%
- In risk-on: +25-35%

**Falsification trigger:** If next 2 mid-cap (Stage 2-3) BEAT + CATEGORY prints produce REACTIONS <10%, L23 is wrong / market structure has changed.

**Validation cases for monitoring:**
- SYNA Q4 FY26 (~Aug 2026) — load-bearing N=1 forward test
- LSCC next print (~Aug 2026) — N=2 forward test
- AMBA next print — N=3 forward test

**Re-eval trigger:** Each of above prints + monthly codification audit 2026-06-24.

## L24 (NEW candidate — origin 2026-06-09 user articulation + Taiyo Yuden live validation)

**Origin:** User correction 2026-06-09 on my Stage 4 framing of Taiyo Yuden (6976.T) after the stock 4×'d YTD and broke its 26-year ATH (2000 IT bubble peak) on May 8 2026 Q4 FY26 print (+91% MLCC OP; +50% FY27 guidance; AI server MLCC +80% YoY guidance).

User verbatim: *"a lot of companies actually start really going crazy after they reach all time high. Right? Because then it's... when it turns from a cyclical to a structural play most of the time, if it can fall into that category."* Refined further: *"it's a thesis... more of a technical analysis. Where it's of charting... they do not always per se become rules. It can show that there are some signals that can be met and increases the possibility of a breakout. It does not mean it happens... if something has been trading sideways for a while and then breaks an all time high, that there is an inflection upwards. How long that inflection lasts and how severe the magnitude of that inflection is is dependent on other variables and functions."*

**Pattern statement:** Extended sideways trading (multi-year+) followed by ATH break **increases the probability** of subsequent multi-year structural inflection, **but does not guarantee** it. Magnitude and duration of post-break trajectory are DEPENDENT on other variables (cycle strength, narrative quality, foreign-analyst coverage lag, fundamental acceleration). Treated as a probabilistic TECHNICAL-ANALYSIS signal augmenting fundamental analysis, NOT a standalone trading rule.

**Distinction from L21:** L21 default treats Stage 4 + ATH proximity + crowded consensus + macro risk-off = NEGATIVE reaction default. L24 REFINES L21 for mid-cap structural-inflection setups — for mid/small-cap names with decade+ sideways trading + earnings finally catching up to thesis + cyclical-to-structural narrative transition + foreign analyst lag + industry-wide cycle, ATH-break is MORE LIKELY structural inflection than Stage 4 exhaustion. The two frameworks apply to DIFFERENT name classes (mega-cap crowded vs mid-cap decade-sideways).

**Base-rate probabilities (my model — preliminary, awaits N+ validation):**

- H1 (P=60%) Pattern triggers structural inflection (post-break compounding ≥2× over 18-36 months) when paired with confirmed earnings acceleration + cycle inflection
- H2 (P=25%) Pattern triggers consolidation phase (3-12 months) then resumption; eventual structural inflection but with material drawdown first
- H3 (P=15%) Pattern false-positive — break is exhaustion (no fundamental support); mean-reversion follows
- **Aggregate P(post-break compounding within 24 months) ~60-70% (my model) when accompanied by fundamental setup; lower if pattern alone**

**Magnitude/duration dependency variables (load-bearing per user articulation "dependent on other variables and functions"):**

| Variable | Effect on magnitude/duration |
|---|---|
| Cycle strength (e.g., MLCC sold out through 2027 per Murata president) | Stronger cycle → longer + deeper inflection |
| Earnings trajectory at break (accelerating vs flat) | Accelerating → multi-year compounder; flat → consolidation more likely |
| Foreign analyst coverage lag | More lag → more rerating runway; less lag → shorter runway |
| Cyclical-to-structural narrative transition strength | Stronger transition → multi-year; weaker → cyclical mean reversion |
| Industry-wide vs single-name pricing power | Industry-wide → more sustainable; single-name → fragility |
| Macro regime (risk-on vs risk-off) | Risk-on → multiplier; risk-off → drag on magnitude |
| Market cap (mid/small vs mega) | Mid/small with decade+ sideways → higher rerating potential; mega-cap → crowding caveat dominates |

**Retrospective validation candidates already in scope (N=4 historical + N=1 live):**

| Name | Sideways duration | ATH break date | Post-break trajectory | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NVDA | 2021-2023 | 2023 | +5× over 18 months | Confirmed +structural |
| Mitsui Mining (5706.T) | Multi-year | ~2025 on HVLP4 narrative | +10× in 12 months | Confirmed +structural |
| Murata (post-2025 cycle bottom) | 2020-2025 | 2026 | +50% rally + cycle inflection | Confirmed +structural |
| Taiyo Yuden (6976.T) | **26 years (2000 IT bubble peak)** | May 2026 | **4× YTD through June (live)** | **N=1 LIVE — origin case for codification** |
| ASML | 2021-2024 | 2024 | Continued upside + EUV rerating | Confirmed +structural |

**Application to held cohort (forward monitoring candidates):**

| Name | Sideways setup | Pattern trigger condition |
|---|---|---|
| SUMCO (held 415) | 17-year (2007 ATH) | If breaks 2007 ATH on AI-grade mix-shift cycle 2027-2028 → structural-inflection candidate |
| Hirano (held 300) | Multi-year post-2022 ATH | If breaks ATH on MLCC capex tooling cycle → structural-inflection candidate |
| AGC (held 100) | Long sideways since 2006 ATH | Distant; requires sustained AI cycle through 2027+ |
| MUR (held 201) | Multi-year consolidation broken 2026 | Already mid-phase post-break compounding |

**Layer it operates at:** This is at the REASONING layer of GRADE — it modifies how the L21 sector regime modifier is applied for mid-cap structural-inflection cases. Composes with L22 (beat-analyst-consensus) and L23 (market-cap-inverse reaction asymmetry).

**Calibration adjustment:** For mid/small-cap names meeting the 7-condition fundamental setup, ATH-break entry is NOT chasing momentum — it's participating in the structural-inflection phase. Position-implication framing should reflect structural-rerating opportunity rather than Stage 4 exhaustion caveat.

**Falsifier conditions:**
- TY post-ATH-break trajectory turns into >30% drawdown without resumption within 18 months → L24 pattern weakened
- 3+ N=2-N=5 candidates emerge in 12 months where pattern fires WITHOUT compounding → framework invalidated
- Pattern only effective in Japan TSE / Taiwan TWSE structural-rerating context (not US mega-cap) → narrower scope codification needed

**Re-eval trigger:** TY live follow-through 6+ months (continues compounding through Q1 FY27 print late July OR consolidates); monthly codification audit 2026-06-24; SUMCO + Hirano + AGC pattern-trigger monitoring as additional N+ data points.

**Self-correction note (per Critical Rule #11):** Yesterday's framing of TY as "Stage 4 momentum, chasing post-26-yr ATH break" was WRONG under this corrected framework. The CORRECT framing is structural-inflection-phase entry. This L24 codification is the framework correction so the error doesn't recur for SUMCO + Hirano + AGC when their ATH-break conditions trigger.

## Principle #37 candidate — Multi-Variable Contextualized Reasoning Chain (MVCRC)

**Origin:** 2026-06-04 PM user articulation in SYNA DEEP-DIG context: *"Don't read the expectation as a single data point. Ideally, that will feed one into another... using them in isolation does not usually yield the best reasoning chain... systems thinking is what you can excel at if you know how the system looks and what you need to do to keep the system up to date. So every single part of the system can feed into one another to then build a better, bigger holistic view, and then you go from the macro to the micro."*

**Pattern:** Default analyst sequence starts with expectations FIRST (consensus → adjust → conclusion). MVCRC inverts the sequence — expectations are the LAST input. Macro context, company position, competition, events, trajectory, beneficiary classification, obviousness check all FEED INTO each other before expectations layer is applied.

**The 9-step MVCRC sequence:**

| Step | Variable | What it feeds into |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Macro / world vision (AI epoch, scenarios, current bottleneck) | Sets regime context for everything downstream |
| 2 | Company position (layer in stack, customer base, segment mix) | Anchors candidate evaluation |
| 3 | Competitive landscape (verified comp set, moat, share dynamics) | Filters structurally weak names |
| 4 | Event delta (what changed since last earnings — cohort prints, signals, news) | Updates prior since last fundamental check |
| 5 | AI trajectory mapping (where the puck is going) | Tests forward-relevance |
| 6 | Beneficiary classification (primary / secondary / indirect / casualty) | Translates exposure to magnitude |
| 7 | Obviousness check (is consensus already there? structural rerating room?) | Tests asymmetric edge vs consensus |
| 8 | Expectations overlay (analyst consensus + sell-side commentary — LAST input) | Anchors stock-reaction prediction (NOT fundamentals) |
| 9 | Probabilistic conclusion (guide direction, beat/miss probability, magnitude band) | Output: actionable PREDICT |

**Key principle:** Each variable feeds into the next; using in isolation produces weak reasoning chain. Direction: macro → micro WITH feedback between variables. LLM-native advantage = hold all variables simultaneously, cross-check, update.

**Integrates with existing framework:**
- L1 (never start with sell-side and adjust) — formalized at step 8 (expectations last)
- Principle #2 (N-th order > 1st) — built into steps 4-6 (cascade through events → trajectory → beneficiary)
- Principle #29 (segment-classify before triangulating) — applied at step 3 (competitive)
- L22 (beat-analyst-consensus test) — applied at step 8 against consensus from step 7
- L23 (market-cap-inverse reaction asymmetry) — applied at step 9 conclusion

**Forward validation cases:**
- SYNA Q4 FY26 PREDICT (Aug 2026) — N=1 forward application
- NVDA Q2 FY27 PREDICT (Aug 2026) — N=2 forward application

**Falsification trigger:** If MVCRC-derived PREDICTs systematically produce HIGHER error rates than expectations-first PREDICTs over N=4+ applications, MVCRC framework adds overhead without analytical benefit → retire.

**Re-eval trigger:** Each MVCRC-applied PREDICT + monthly codification audit 2026-06-24.

## Principle #38 candidate — Compounding-Signal-Density Pre-Print Entry

**Origin:** 2026-06-04 PM user critique of SYNA "wait for Q4 BEAT" position framework: *"if you're waiting for the beat, you're just waiting for everybody. the novelty in your own reasoning does not rely on waiting for the obvious to happen to then spot the obvious. by that point, it's too late. ideally, over time, you can hold multiple different frameworks, multiple different competing point of views. and whenever I feed new data to you or at some point, when we start implementing scripts, would you do your own research on a daily basis, plus what I send you... if it's on the candidates list, what you wanna do is you want to show it that if it cascades and you see more and more signals, it then solidifies a entry before the beat actually happens as a new finder pattern before the actual beats."*

**Pattern:** Default "wait for print confirmation" entry posture cedes the asymmetric pre-consensus-revision window. Edge lives in the period where signal density compounds but analysts haven't formally raised yet. By the time the print happens, the asymmetric trade is gone (priced).

**The 5-element Principle #38 mechanism:**

1. **Candidate on active watchlist** with explicit signal-accumulation tracker
2. **Density threshold criteria** (my model — to validate against forward applications):
   - N=4+ independent signals
   - ≥3 of them T1-T2
   - ≥2 directly impact the candidate (vs cohort-level only)
   - No significant contradictory signals
3. **Tiered entry sizing** (addresses sequence-of-returns risk):
   - Stage 1: density threshold crossed → 25-33% of target sizing
   - Stage 2: additional confirming events → +33-50%
   - Stage 3: print confirmation → remaining 25-50%
4. **Falsification protocol**: contradictory T1 signal → exit Stage 1 at small loss; thesis pivoted
5. **LLM-native advantage**: hold all signals simultaneously, cross-reference, update density score in real time as new data ingests

**Integrates with existing framework:**
- L1 (sell-side last) — formalized: enter BEFORE sell-side updates
- Principle #37 (MVCRC) — used at obviousness step (step 7) to validate density
- L22 (beat-analyst-consensus) — applied as Stage 3 confirmation check
- L23 (mid-cap asymmetry) — calibrates Stage 3 reaction band
- B42 (pre-print rally exhaustion) — applies if stock has rallied >10% in 5 days at Stage 1 → wait for pullback before Stage 1
- Portfolio constraints (no-income + €200K cash) — tiered sizing protects against full-position loss

**Forward validation cases:**
- SYNA Q4 FY26 (Aug 2026) — N=1 forward test; Stage 1 NOW; Stage 2 on Iran-deal binary; Stage 3 on print
- LSCC next print (Aug 2026) — N=2 forward test (would require signal density check)
- AMBA next print — N=3 forward test

**Falsification trigger:** If 2+ Principle #38-triggered Stage 1 entries produce >-10% losses at thesis falsification (contradictory signal emerges), framework over-fits density threshold → tighten criteria.

**Self-correction note:** Prior thesis-build position-implication defaults ("wait for print BEAT + 2 qualitative disclosures") were anti-Principle-#38. Going forward, all watchlist candidates get explicit signal-density tracking and Stage 1 entry recommendations BEFORE print.

**Re-eval trigger:** Each Stage 1 entry + monthly codification audit 2026-06-24.

## L14 FIRST FALSIFICATION (added 2026-06-04 from AVGO Q2 FY26 GRADE)

L14 codified at N=2 (NVDA + HPE): "Stage 3-4 + CATEGORY EVENT → +25-40% T+24h."

**AVGO Q2 FY26 (2026-06-03 print) is the first major falsification:**
- Stage 4 narrative status: YES
- CATEGORY EVENT: YES (Anthropic 5GW from 2027 + multi-gen Google TPU + Q3 AI semi $16B +200% YoY + FY27 AI >$100B framing)
- Predicted T+24h: +25-40% per L14; my weighted call was +11-13% (capped for already-AI-narrative)
- Actual T+24h: **-3 to -13.78% AH** (wrong direction)

**Refinement candidate (L14-v2):** Pre-print rally >10% in 5 days OFFSETS the BEAT + CATEGORY signal. Add the pre-print expectations-exhaustion modifier:
- L14 original (still applies): Stage 3-4 + CATEGORY EVENT + pre-print rally <10% over 5 days → +25-40% T+24h
- L14-v2 NEW: Stage 3-4 + CATEGORY EVENT + pre-print rally >10% over 5 days → 0% to -15% T+24h (expectations exhaustion dominates)

Plus L20 below (macro-confounder discount) and L19 below (multi-year framing vs FY raise gap).

Falsification trigger for L14-v2: 2+ more cases where pre-print rally >10% but BEAT+CATEGORY still drives positive T+24h reaction. If that happens, L14-v2 is wrong and we keep L14 original.

---

## L17 — TOMBSTONE (number never codified; added 2026-07-06 harness audit)

**L17 has no lesson text.** The number was referenced as a live "L17 candidate" by `predictions/2026-06-12-KIOXIA-VLSI-symposium-pre-registration.md` and graded as "L17 candidate test N=1 resolution" in `grading-log.md`, but the lesson itself was never written into this file — the insight was absorbed into the L14 family (Stage-4 expectations / T+24h reaction mechanics). Do not cite L17 as a standing lesson; treat legacy L17 references as pointers to the L14/L14-v2 block above.

## L18 — TOMBSTONE (intentionally skipped; added 2026-07-06 harness audit)

**L18 has no lesson text.** During the 2026-06-03 AVGO grading cycle it was recognized as a duplicate of an existing methodology principle and deliberately not codified (see `predictions/2026-06-03-AVGO-Q2FY26.md`). The number stays reserved to keep downstream numbering (L19+) stable.

---

## L19 (NEW — N=1 from AVGO Q2 FY26 GRADE 2026-06-04) — Multi-year framing vs FY-print raise gap

**Origin:** AVGO Q2 FY26 GRADE 2026-06-04. Predicted FY26 AI raise from implied $30B → $32-35B. Actual: NO FY26 raise, but multi-year framing **FY27 AI >$100B reiterated**. Total magnitude was actually larger than I projected (FY27 >$100B is 2.5-3x my FY26 $32-35B estimate spread over 12 more months) but the FRAMING was read by market as "no Q4 raise" = disappointment.

**Pattern:** When management uses multi-year (FY+1, FY+2) revenue framing INSTEAD of explicit current-FY raise, traders interpret as management "not playing into narrative" → negative T+24h reaction even if multi-year magnitude is larger. Conservative multi-year framing reads as ambiguity, not bullishness.

**Generalizable lesson:** When predicting CATEGORY EVENT magnitude, model TWO scenarios:
1. **FY-raise framing** — management explicitly raises current-FY guide by X% → positive T+24h reaction
2. **Multi-year framing** — management gives FY+1 or FY+2 framing INSTEAD of current-FY raise → can be negative T+24h reaction even if multi-year magnitude is larger

Listen for which framing is used. If multi-year framing wins, the BEAT+CATEGORY signal is partially neutralized.

**Layer failed:** REASONING — assumed FY26 raise as the CATEGORY EVENT shape; actual was multi-year framing which has different market reading.

**Calibration adjustment:** For Stage 4 names predicting BEAT+CATEGORY, model multi-year vs FY-raise as separate distributions with different T+24h reaction profiles.

**Falsification trigger:** If next 2 predictions with multi-year-vs-FY-raise modeling produce wrong direction calls, L19 is wrong.

---

## L20 (NEW — N=1 from AVGO Q2 FY26 GRADE 2026-06-04) — Macro-confounder T+24h interpretation discount

**Origin:** AVGO Q2 FY26 GRADE 2026-06-04. Print landed on June 3, 2026 — same day Brent oil rising on Netanyahu/CNBC remarks that US/Israel prepared to attack Iran again; Iran-Israel-US war ongoing since Feb 28, 2026 (Operation Epic Fury); Strait of Hormuz crisis active. Risk-off macro backdrop confounded the T+24h stock reaction signal.

**Pattern:** T+24h stock-reaction grades during major geopolitical risk-off events (oil spike + war headlines on print day) should be interpretation-discounted by ~50%. Fundamental grade unaffected; stock-reaction signal-to-noise compressed materially.

**Generalizable lesson:** Before any T+24h stock-reaction grade, check macro backdrop:
1. Brent oil intraday move >2%?
2. Major geopolitical headline within 24h of print?
3. VIX >25 OR semi sector ETF down >2% intraday?

If any TWO of those YES → halve the interpretive weight on T+24h reaction; fundamental grade remains primary.

**Calibration adjustment:** Two-Part GRADE Protocol gets a macro-confounder adjustment line in every T+24h grade: "macro context = neutral / risk-on / risk-off / extreme risk-off; interpretation weight = 100% / 75% / 50% / 25%."

**Falsification trigger:** If next 2 T+24h grades during macro risk-off events produce IDIOSYNCRATIC signal as strong as macro-neutral cases, L20 is wrong.

## Meta-posture — the epistemic stance for predictions (codified 2026-05-27)

**User framing 2026-05-27:** *"There is no failure or success. There's only data points, and what you learn from them, how you compute them, how you reason through them."*

Predictions are not performance artifacts. They are structured data-generation exercises. The point of writing a prediction down BEFORE the resolving event is to expose the inputs, computation, and reasoning chain to verifiable contact with reality. The GRADE that follows is not a verdict — it is the data point that closes the loop.

**Three things to learn from on every prediction (separately gradable):**
1. **What you learn from the data** — were the inputs you used current, complete, and correctly weighted? Did you miss a public data point that would have shifted the call?
2. **How you compute** — was the math/model/formula you applied structurally correct? Did the bottoms-up framework actually represent the system, or did it collapse onto a single-driver assumption?
3. **How you reason through** — was the logical chain from data → computation → conclusion sound? Did you correctly carry uncertainty through hedge bands? Did you check biases-watchlist before concluding?

The OUTCOME (right/wrong by how much) is the diagnostic test that tells you WHICH of the three layers failed. The outcome is not the lesson — the lesson lives in which layer (input/computation/reasoning) was misaligned and why.

**Implication for GRADE workflow:** every grade must explicitly identify which of the three layers explains the gap between prediction and reality. "Wrong by 3%" is not a lesson. "Wrong by 3% because INPUT was stale by 2 quarters" or "wrong by 3% because COMPUTATION over-weighted seasonal ratio at the expense of pricing-change effect" is a lesson.

**Implication for the OS posture broadly:** predictions are not bets to win or lose. They are instruments. The bigger the gap between prediction and reality (in either direction), the richer the data point — provided we can identify which layer failed. A "directionally right but magnitude wrong" prediction yields a different lesson than "directionally wrong but reasoning sound" — and both yield more learning than "directionally and magnitudinally right by accident."

This stance applies retroactively: NVDA Q1 FY27 was graded RIGHT on direction across all 4 axes, but the lesson (L4 — sandbag heuristic mismatched the contracted-demand regime) is more valuable than the score.

## Lessons (most recent first)

### L16 (CANDIDATE — N=1; awaiting N=2 per principle #32 premortem)

**Origin:** HPE Q2 FY26 GRADE 2026-06-02. Predicted AI backlog $7-9B using DELL's +19% sequential backlog accumulation pattern as anchor. Actual: $5.9B (+18% sequential). The percentage sequential growth rate was nearly identical between my anchor and the actual — but the absolute dollar level was $1.1B below my low band because I anchored the dollar level on DELL's higher baseline rather than HPE's lower baseline, AND I incorrectly applied DELL's backlog-accumulation sub-mechanism to HPE, which was in a backlog-conversion (rapid shipment) mode.

**Pattern:** When applying a cohort's backlog signal, the cohort company and the target company may be in DIFFERENT operational modes relative to the same demand environment. DELL was in ACCUMULATION mode (orders >> shipments, backlog building); HPE was in CONVERSION mode (strong shipments chewing through prior backlog faster than new orders added to it). Same AI server demand environment; opposite backlog dynamics.

**Generalizable lesson:** For future predictions involving AI backlog metrics using a cohort signal, explicitly specify the sub-mechanism being modeled:
- **ACCUMULATION mode** (orders > shipments): apply cohort % sequential growth rate AND use cohort's absolute scale as a proportion of the target's established backlog. Expect backlog to grow sequentially.
- **CONVERSION mode** (shipments >> incremental orders): backlog grows more modestly even in strong demand, because the company is executing through prior commitments. The primary signal of conversion mode: management language about "delivery pacing," "shipment acceleration," "AI systems bookings converting to revenue."

**Infer the mode from:** (a) prior-quarter management commentary on delivery timing; (b) whether the company is guided to grow revenue faster than orders (conversion signal) or guided revenue < orders (accumulation signal); (c) whether the company discloses "cumulative bookings" language (implies they track the conversion funnel).

**Calibration adjustment:** In CONVERSION mode, expect backlog growth of 10-25% sequential even in strong AI demand; in ACCUMULATION mode, expect backlog growth of 20-50%+ sequential from the same demand environment.

**Layer failed:** REASONING — the cohort sub-mechanism was applied without checking which mode the target was in.

**Falsification criterion:** if next 2+ AI backlog predictions correctly classify ACCUMULATION vs CONVERSION mode and produce calibrated band estimates, L16 is confirmed. If mode classification proves unpredictable, retire L16 and accept AI backlog as low-confidence metric.

**Re-eval trigger:** monthly audit 2026-06-24 OR next earnings prediction involving AI server backlog metric.

### L15 — Check pending corporate transactions before any EPS prediction (INPUT checklist discipline)

**Origin:** HPE Q2 FY26 GRADE 2026-06-02. Non-GAAP EPS $0.79 vs my $0.57 point estimate (+38% gap). Primary driver: H3C divestiture completion May 28, 2026 — 3 days before HPE's Q2 print. HPE received total pretax consideration ~$3.5B for its H3C stake (most recently ~$1.357B received in Q2 alone per SEC 8-K T1). This was a PUBLIC SEC filing prior to my prediction date (2026-05-29) but I did not check it. H3C monetization was the single largest gap in my EPS model.

**Layer failed:** INPUT — the data was publicly available at prediction time; I failed to run the corporate-event check as a standard step.

**Generalizable lesson:** Before any EPS prediction for a company with known pending corporate restructuring (M&A, divestiture, JV exit, asset sale), explicitly check SEC EDGAR (or company investor page) for:
- Any announced-but-not-yet-closed M&A transaction
- Any pending divestiture with known Q-level timing
- Any asset monetization with Q-specific cash recognition scheduled

These are PUBLIC data points that cause material EPS deviations from operations-only models. The failure mode is treating the company as a pure operating entity when a balance-sheet event is about to close with Q-level cash impact.

**Calibration adjustment:** Add "corporate event check" as a MANDATORY pre-prediction input validation step. Specifically: before finalizing any EPS estimate, check the target company's most recent 8-K filings in the prior 90 days for: "divestiture," "acquisition closing," "asset sale," "proceeds received," "consideration received." If any is pending or recently closed, model the non-operating EPS impact as a SEPARATE LINE in the EPS model (non-GAAP note: some companies exclude these; GAAP includes them — verify the treatment convention for the specific company before adding).

**Distinction from L1/L4:** L1 says build bottoms-up before consensus. L4 says apply smaller sandbag in contracted-demand environments. L15 adds: the bottoms-up INPUT layer must explicitly include pending corporate transactions, not just the operating segment model. Even a perfect operations-only model will systematically miss EPS when a divestiture closes in the quarter.

**Falsification criterion:** if next 3 EPS predictions include the corporate-event check AND produce calibrated EPS calls (no material non-operating EPS gap unexplained), L15 is confirmed as a workflow discipline. If the corporate-event check becomes a wasted step (no companies have pending transactions at prediction time), the checklist item is low-cost overhead — keep it.

### L14 (CODIFIED 2026-06-02 at N=2 — upgraded from CANDIDATE)

**N=2 data point:** HPE Q2 FY26 (Stage 3-4 + CATEGORY EVENT) → +29-36% T+24h. This is the independent cross-day validation required to codify. MRVL was N=1 (Stage 3-4 + TREND ACCELERATION → -2%). HPE confirms the CATEGORY-vs-TREND distinction holds AND extends the framework: a CATEGORY EVENT can override Stage 3-4 suppression when the structural change is large enough.

**Pattern (codified):** Distinguish CATEGORY EVENTS from TREND EVENTS in earnings-driven stock reactions. Stage classification alone under-predicts magnitude when CATEGORY EVENT compounds with stage positioning. CATEGORY EVENT at any stage produces 50-100%+ larger T+0-to-T+48h moves than TREND EVENT at the same stage.

**Markers of CATEGORY EVENT (codified):**
- New strategic relationship disclosed (SNOW Q1 FY27: signed $6B AWS pact)
- Baseline-break in previously-stable metric (SNOW: NRR 125% → 126%; HPE: revenue growth +18% YoY → +40% YoY in a single quarter)
- Multi-year guidance FRAMEWORK INTRODUCTION (HPE: FY27 framework with 8-12% revenue / 12-16% EPS / FCF ≥$4.5B — NEW baseline, not a continuation)
- Balance-sheet transformation via asset monetization at >10% market cap scale (HPE: $3.5B H3C exit)
- Management metric reframe to leading indicators (SNOW: dropped Cortex $ run rate → volume metrics per L10)

**Markers of TREND EVENT (codified):**
- Incremental beat-and-raise within existing framework
- Outlook upgrade extending existing trend (no new framework, no new vintage)
- No new strategic relationships, metric reframe, or baseline-break

**Full codified framework table:**

| Stage | Beat type | Mgmt narrative | T+24h move | Origin case(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stage 2-3 | HIGH-CONCRETE CATEGORY (signed strategic deal + metric baseline-break + leading-indicator reframe) | Bullish | **~+37%** | SNOW Q1 FY27 |
| Stage 2-3 | TREND ACCELERATION (incremental beat + guidance raise) | Bullish | **~+20%** | MDB Q1 FY27 |
| Stage 2-3 | LOW-CONCRETE CATEGORY (new product + co-engineering; no signed deal) | Bullish | **~+10%** | NTAP Q4 FY26 |
| Stage 1-2 (deep discount) | BEAT with intact fundamentals | NEGATIVE — mgmt commoditizing own category | **~-11%** | ESTC Q1 CY26 |
| Stage 3-4 | TREND ACCELERATION | Bullish | **~-2%** (Stage premium dominates) | MRVL Q1 FY27 |
| **Stage 3-4** | **CATEGORY EVENT (multi-year framework intro + revenue baseline-break + balance-sheet transformation)** | **Bullish** | **~+29-36%** | **HPE Q2 FY26 (N=2 codification)** |

**Key refinement from N=2 (HPE):** A CATEGORY EVENT can overcome Stage 3-4 positioning headwinds. The threshold for Stage 3-4 CATEGORY override appears to be: multi-year guidance framework introduction OR revenue growth acceleration >20pp YoY OR balance-sheet transformation >10% of market cap. When any of these materialize, expect +25-40% reactions at Stage 3-4 (not +1-5% TREND suppression).

**Calibration adjustment:** When running PREDICT on any Stage 3-4 name, explicitly classify the expected print as CATEGORY vs TREND before assigning the stock-reaction band. If CATEGORY markers are present, override Stage 3-4 suppression and use +20-40% stock-reaction band instead of +1-5%.

**Generalizable lesson:** Stage 3-4 stock-reaction discount is CATEGORY-EVENT-CONDITIONAL, not stage-only. Principle #31 narrative-stage modifier now requires CATEGORY-vs-TREND axis as additional input for stock-reaction prediction.

**Falsification criterion (updated at N=2):** if next 2+ Stage 3-4 names with CATEGORY EVENT setup produce moves in the +1-5% range (Stage 3-4 suppression dominates despite CATEGORY markers), the CATEGORY override at Stage 3-4 was over-fit to HPE single cross-day N=2 data point. Current N=2 is sufficient for codification per principle #32 but insufficient for high confidence — active monitoring required.

**Origin cases:** SNOW Q1 FY27 (N=1 origin, Stage 2-3), MRVL Q1 FY27 (Stage 3-4 TREND baseline), MDB/NTAP/ESTC (same-day cohort 2026-05-28), HPE Q2 FY26 (N=2, Stage 3-4 CATEGORY codification).

### L13 — When predicting management commentary upgrades, model the VINTAGE choice as a separate probability distribution

**Origin:** MRVL Q1 FY27 GRADE 2026-05-28. Predicted 60% prob FY27 custom Si floor raised above >20%. Actual: FY27 maintained at ">20%"; FY28 NEW commentary "more than double" (>100% YoY). Direction right (bullish upgrade); vintage wrong (FY28 not FY27). Trainium3 ramps Q2-Q4 FY27 → meaningful FY28 not FY27 P&L impact — mgmt put the bullish reveal where the ramp materially impacts revenue.

**Generalizable lesson:** Management commentary upgrades come at a SPECIFIC vintage. The vintage is a function of (a) when the underlying ramp materially impacts revenue, (b) mgmt's preference to give themselves room not to under-deliver near-term. Both factors typically favor the later-vintage reveal.

**Calibration adjustment:** When predicting management commentary upgrades, replace binary "will they upgrade or not" with vintage-distribution: P(current FY raise), P(next FY raise), P(both), P(neither). Sum to 100%. Apply ramp-timing logic to weight vintages — if structural driver impacts year N+1 P&L > year N P&L, weight P(next FY raise) higher than P(current FY raise).

**Validation criterion:** Apply to next 2+ predictions involving management multi-year commentary. If vintage-distribution framing produces calibrated calls, L13 confirmed.

**HPE Q2 FY26 validation note (2026-06-02):** L13 vintage-distribution was applied to HPE Target 5. Predicted FY26 raise (45% probability) AND positive FY27 commentary (50% probability). Both materialized, and at the most concrete form (specific FY27 growth framework). L13 validation criteria met across both MRVL (N=1) and HPE (N=2) applications. L13 confirmed as codified.

---

### L12 — When stating YoY growth %, ALWAYS verify the year-ago base independently

**Origin:** MRVL Q1 FY27 GRADE 2026-05-28. Predicted datacenter +42-47% YoY based on sequential math (Q4 FY26 $1.65B + 10% sequential = $1.815B). Actual +27% YoY ($1.833B). The DOLLAR forecast was right within 1%; the YoY % framing was wrong because I never checked the Q1 FY26 base (~$1.443B implied) — I implicitly conflated sequential math with YoY math.

**Generalizable lesson:** Sequential growth and YoY growth are structurally DIFFERENT metrics. When stating a YoY %, pull the year-ago base from the company 10-Q/10-K and compute YoY = (current - year_ago) / year_ago. NEVER infer YoY from sequential without the year-ago anchor.

**Calibration adjustment:** Any future prediction containing a YoY % must cite the year-ago base inline. This is a REASONING-layer discipline.

**Falsification:** if next 3+ predictions stating YoY % do so with explicit year-ago citation AND remain calibrated, L12 has become habit.

---

### L11 — When revenue beat is small (<1% above consensus), EPS magnification flow-through is muted, not amplified

**Origin:** MRVL Q1 FY27 GRADE 2026-05-28. L6 said apply MORE sandbag-reduction at EPS line than revenue in contracted-demand. Predicted $0.82 EPS; actual $0.80 (in line with consensus high end). L6 over-applied because revenue beat itself was small (~0.3% above consensus) → multi-layer flow-through (revenue × margin × tax × shares) did NOT compound the way L6 assumed.

**Generalizable lesson:** L6's EPS-amplification calibration applies when revenue beat is >1-2% above consensus. When revenue beat is small (<1%), apply NO EPS-line amplification beyond bottoms-up — let the EPS forecast track the revenue forecast 1-to-1.

**Calibration adjustment:** L6 is now CONDITIONAL — apply only when revenue forecast itself exceeds consensus by >1%. Otherwise revert to bottoms-up EPS without amplification overlay.

**Falsification:** if next 2+ EPS predictions in contracted-demand environments show consistent EPS magnification beyond revenue magnitude regardless of revenue beat size, L11 was over-fit to MRVL single data point.

---

### L10 — When management RE-FRAMES metrics, infer from the TYPE of metric chosen

**Origin:** SNOW Q1 FY27 GRADE 2026-05-27. Mgmt did NOT re-quantify Cortex AI dollar run rate (Q4 FY26 disclosed $100M; pricing cut April 2026 created optics dilemma per my prediction). I predicted 30% probability of "bear scenario — mgmt avoids dollar number due to weakness." MECHANISM matched (no $ disclosed) but IMPLICATION was opposite — mgmt confidently shifted to volume metrics: 13,600+ AI accounts (+49% QoQ from ~9,100), Snowflake Intelligence doubled QoQ, Cortex Code 7,100+ accounts. This was a BULLISH reframe, not defensive.

**Generalizable lesson:** When mgmt drops a previously-cited dollar metric and shifts to a new metric type, infer from the TYPE:
- **Leading indicators** (account counts, usage growth, engagement, accounts using feature X) = signal of CONFIDENCE; mgmt is showing fast adoption ahead of revenue translation
- **Lagging indicators** (efficiency ratios, utilization, retention plateaus) = signal of HEDGING; mgmt highlighting stability rather than growth
- **Engagement-quality indicators** (paid users, active users, conversion) = signal of QUALITY confidence; mgmt showing user base is sticky

**Calibration adjustment:** Flip the default. When mgmt SHIFTS to leading indicators after dropping a $ metric, treat as MORE bullish than the missing dollar number suggests, not less. My SNOW base-case predicted "optics dilemma" framing was systematically too bearish on this dimension.

**Validation criterion:** Apply to next 3 earnings predictions where mgmt drops a dollar metric. If pattern holds (leading-indicator reframes = bullish; lagging-indicator reframes = bearish), L10 is confirmed.

---

### L9 — Elastic demand response to pricing cuts can outpace ASP compression WITHIN the same quarter for AI/SaaS products with PMF

**Origin:** SNOW Q1 FY27 GRADE 2026-05-27. NRR inflected UP to 126% from stable 125% 4-quarter baseline DESPITE the 70% Cortex AI pricing cut in April 2026. My model predicted slight dip to 124% based on 2-3 quarter elasticity lag assumption. **Actual: volume compensation happened WITHIN the same quarter.** Cohort evidence: 13,600+ AI accounts (+49% QoQ), Intelligence doubled QoQ, Cortex Code 7,100+ accounts.

**Mechanism:** When pricing cuts trigger elastic demand response in a product with strong PMF (queued demand previously capacity-constrained at higher ASP), the volume tailwind can compensate ASP compression IMMEDIATELY. Traditional cyclical-product elasticity-lag models (MU/SNDK NAND-cycle analog: 2-4 quarter response) DO NOT generalize to AI/SaaS PMF products which can respond in 1 quarter.

**Generalizable lesson:** For future predictions involving pricing cuts on AI/SaaS products with PMF signals, assume volume response in 1-2 quarters not 2-3. Apply specifically when:
- Product was previously CAPACITY-CONSTRAINED at higher ASP (queued demand)
- Pricing cut UNBLOCKS that queued demand
- Existing customers can IMMEDIATELY consume more (consumption-based pricing, not seat-licensed)

**Calibration adjustment:** Does NOT apply to commodity-elastic markets (NAND/DRAM/memory cycles) where traditional 2-4 quarter lag holds.

**Falsification criterion:** If next 2+ AI/SaaS pricing-cut events show volume response taking 2-3 quarters per traditional model, L9 was over-applied to this single SNOW case.

---

### L8 — Structural-acceleration thesis on AI cooling CONFIRMED (positive lesson)

**Origin:** MOD Q4 FY26 GRADE 2026-05-27. DC sub-segment +158% YoY at Modine validates the bypass-route framework — from chip-cooling (Vertiv/Asetek/LiquidStack territory) to facility-cooling (Modine + Vertiv) per the original thesis. The $4B Airedale deal disclosed 2026-05-26 is now PROVEN as forward-bookings visibility, not just announcement noise. Multi-quarter beat-and-raise streak confirms cyclical-to-structural transition per principle #26.

**Reasoning success (not error):** The original MOD PREDICT correctly identified: (a) supply-chain-reality test passed for MOD's actual position in AI DC cooling supply chain (facility-layer, not chip-layer); (b) $4B Airedale deal as multi-quarter forward-bookings visibility (per L4); (c) FY27 DC guide >$1.5B inference. All landed.

**Generalizable lesson:** Cyclical-to-structural transitions per principle #26 produce DC-style sub-segment growth rates (>100% YoY) when the structural-rerating moment arrives. Watch for analogous patterns: SNDK datacenter SSD +233% pattern; HYNIX HBM stack-height crowding-out; LSCC server platform control +85% YoY FY2025; MRVL custom Si Trainium ramp. The signature of structural transition: sub-segment growth materially exceeds total-company growth + accelerates over multiple quarters.

**Calibration adjustment:** Continue applying principle #26's binding-constraint test to all candidates surfacing >100% YoY sub-segment growth signals. When confirmed, the multiple deserves chokepoint comp-set treatment per principle #30, not cyclical comp-set treatment.

---

### L7 — Management margin-recovery guides are HOPES, not contracts

**Origin:** MOD Q4 FY26 GRADE 2026-05-27. Modine's Climate Solutions adj EBITDA margin guide of "+200bps recovery from Q3's 17.9%" delivered only +80bps (to 18.7%). Driver: capacity-ramp friction + tariffs + weather-related labor/overtime costs suppressed CS gross margin -510bps YoY even as $$ adj EBITDA grew +63% YoY. These friction factors were FORESEEABLE — they were already happening in Q3 — but the recovery framework didn't model them.

**Reasoning error:** Accepted mgmt's "+200bps recovery" guide at face value. Same pattern as B17 (user-deference bias) but applied to management commentary rather than user input. Mgmt's margin-execution guides are systematically biased toward their plan, not the friction reality. The capacity-expansion phase introduces costs that mgmt's recovery narrative under-models.

**Generalizable lesson:** When mgmt gives a margin-recovery guide that depends on internal execution (capacity absorption, tariff pass-through, mix shift, supply-chain normalization), apply a 30-50% haircut to the guided recovery MAGNITUDE. Direction is usually right; magnitude is usually optimistic. Apply principle #14 (question framings) to mgmt guides, not just own framings.

**Distinction from L4:** L4 says mgmt UNDER-promises on top-line in contracted-demand environments. L7 says mgmt OVER-promises on margin-execution recovery. Both can be true simultaneously — under-promise on demand visibility AND over-promise on execution friction recovery.

**Calibration adjustment:** For future predictions involving mgmt margin-recovery guides, apply 30-50% haircut to the guided magnitude. Verify by tracking next 3 predictions where mgmt gives a specific bps recovery guide — if pattern holds, L7 is confirmed.

---

### L6 — L4's smaller-sandbag-adjustment applies MORE aggressively at the EPS/margin line than at the revenue line

**Origin:** Same pattern recurring across two graded predictions:
- NVDA Q1 FY27 GRADE 2026-05-20: Q2 guide undercalled by $2.5B (predicted $88.5B vs actual $91.0B). L4 codified: smaller sandbag in contracted-demand environments.
- MOD Q4 FY26 GRADE 2026-05-27: adj EPS undercalled by $0.13-0.19 (predicted $1.52-1.58 vs actual $1.71). Revenue magnitude undercalled by ~70bps vs consensus. EPS magnitude undercalled by ~590bps vs consensus.

**Reasoning error:** Applied L4 sandbag-adjustment to revenue but failed to apply consistently to EPS. Revenue line is constrained by guide framework + bottoms-up unit economics; EPS has compounding flow-through from revenue beat + margin expansion + tax/interest mix. The standard sandbag heuristic discounts EPS magnitude even more aggressively than revenue magnitude — because each layer of conservatism (revenue + margin + tax + share count) stacks multiplicatively, not additively.

**Generalizable lesson:** In contracted-demand environments (currently: NVDA, AVGO, TSM, NBIS, HYNIX, MU, MRVL custom Si, MOD, possibly LSCC, SNDK), apply L4 smaller-sandbag-haircut MORE aggressively at the EPS line than at the revenue line. Specifically: ~2% sandbag haircut on revenue, ~3-5% reduced sandbag haircut on EPS (i.e., expect more EPS upside surprise relative to consensus than revenue upside surprise).

**Validation criterion:** if next 3+ predictions in contracted-demand environments show direction-right + magnitude-undercall on EPS, L6 is confirmed. If EPS predictions become consistently too aggressive after applying L6, L6 needs revision.

**Important interaction with L15 (added 2026-06-02):** L6 EPS amplification applies to OPERATING EPS upside. When a non-operating EPS event (divestiture proceeds, acquisition gain) is present, it must be modeled SEPARATELY per L15. Do not attempt to amplify non-operating EPS using L6 — the mechanism is different (balance sheet, not income statement leverage).

---

### L5 — Check the supply-chain reality before classifying a name as "non-AI"
**Origin:** TE classification GRADE 2026-05-26. The earlier US duration-of-relevance agent classified TE as "this name should NOT be in an AI-sector investing universe" based on TE's marketed business label (solar/battery manufacturer). I accepted at face value. Then Citrini Research "Semis Memo" 2026-05-12 surfaced the Supply Chain Inheritance thesis — citing NVDA's own May 2025 technical blog crediting 800V DC rack architecture to "the electric vehicle and solar industries." The physical supply chain TE participates in OVERLAPS with AI data center infrastructure. The "NOT AI" classification was a surface-level call that missed the underlying supply-chain reality.

**Reasoning error:** Label-anchoring at the AI-relevance classification step. The agent and I both anchored on the company's marketed end-product label without applying a supply-chain-reality test.

**Generalizable lesson:** Before classifying ANY company as "non-AI" or out-of-AI-universe, run the supply-chain-reality test: (1) identify the underlying physical supply chain the company participates in (not the marketed end-product label); (2) map that supply chain to AI infrastructure layers; (3) check primary-source evidence (chip-vendor engineering blogs, hyperscaler procurement disclosures) for explicit attribution; (4) if ANY layer overlaps, classification ≠ "NOT AI." When evidence supports reclassification, UPDATE THE FILE — don't punt to user via "flag for review."

**Calibration adjustment:** Any future "non-AI" classification must explicitly cite the supply-chain-reality test result, not just the marketed label. If only the label was checked, the classification is provisional and incomplete. See principle #28 + B29 in `meta/biases-watchlist.md`.

**Meta-lesson about accepting agent verdicts:** When I receive a classification from a subagent, the discipline is principle #14 (question own framings) applied to the subagent — not face-value acceptance. The TE miss compounded because I accepted "NOT AI" without independent verification.

---

### L4 — In a multi-year-contracted-demand environment, historical guide-sandbag heuristics over-discount
**Origin:** NVDA Q1 FY27 GRADE 2026-05-20. My prediction called Q2 guide midpoint $88.5B by applying a 4-5% sandbag haircut to an internal-expectation model of $92.7B. Actual guide: $91.0B ± 2% (per [NVIDIA 8-K via StockTitan](https://www.stocktitan.net/sec-filings/NVDA/8-k-nvidia-corp-reports-material-event-56086a88bbb4.html)). My internal-expectation model was nearly right ($92.7B vs $91B = within $1.7B); the sandbag haircut was the error.

**Generalizable lesson:** Management guide-sandbag patterns reflect a particular demand-visibility regime. When the company has FORWARD-CONTRACTED visibility (multi-year customer commits, capacity-constrained backlog like the current OpenAI Guaranteed Capacity + hyperscaler 2026 capex re-rate environment), they guide CLOSER to internal expectation. Historical 4-5% sandbag over-discounts.

**Calibration adjustment:** For predictions on companies in multi-year-contracted-demand environments (currently: NVDA, AVGO, TSM, NBIS, SK Hynix, MU), apply smaller sandbag haircut (~2% instead of 4-5%). For companies in shorter-visibility regimes, original sandbag still applies. Mark this in `meta/methodology.md` when running PREDICT.

**Secondary lesson from same event:** I underweighted Q2 ≥ $90B whisper at 30% probability when it should have been ~50%. The pattern is consistent — my probabilities on upside outcomes were systematically too low because the historical sandbag pattern anchored my model. Calibration adjustment: in capacity-constrained environments, the "whisper exceeded" outcomes are more probable than baseline sell-side cycle would suggest.

**Linked:** L1 (bottoms-up bias still applies — bottoms-up build of $92.7B was correct; the sandbag overlay was the bias).

---

### L3 — Don't take partial profits on an intact bottleneck thesis
**Origin:** User feedback, 2026-05-20. User identified Bloom Energy (BE) early as a bypass-route name for the power constraint (time-to-power thesis). Bought, took ~+30% profit, exited. Stock then continued running and just reported earnings — user reports it was up double digits two trading days in a row. The thesis (Bloom solves the time-to-power problem for hyperscalers needing power in months not years) was never falsified — they sold on the emotional resolution of position uncertainty, not on analysis. Same root cause as L2 (emotional exit on intact thesis), different trigger (partial profit rather than macro fear).

**Generalizable lesson:** When the thesis is "this company is solving a binding constraint that consensus has not yet recognized," the re-rating runway is the full move from "ignored" to "consensus-priced." Selling at +30% on a name in the first inning of that re-rating is leaving the asymmetric leg on the table. The decision to sell must be falsifier-based, not magnitude-of-gain-based.

**Calibration adjustment:** For any name held on a bypass-route thesis, the rebalance rule is: trim to target sizing if the position drifts >2× target due to appreciation. Do NOT exit because of percentage gain alone. Exit only when (a) a written falsifier fires, OR (b) the bottleneck has clearly resolved and the bypass-route is no longer the edge.

**The harder rule:** Profit isn't the signal. Falsification is the signal. If a name has +30% on you and the thesis is intact, that's evidence the thesis is WORKING, not evidence to leave.

**Linked bias:** B9 (emotional sell) and B10 (P/E anchoring on emerging-demand stories).

---

### L2 — Operate ONLY on thesis falsification, never on macro noise
**Origin:** User feedback, 2026-05-20. User held a storage thesis (Sandisk, Kioxia, Seagate) built Dec 2025/Jan 2026 on inference-demand grounds. Sold during a short-term S&P pullback driven by Venezuela macro headwind. Thesis was intact. No falsifier had fired. The sell was emotional risk-management, not analytical discipline.

**Generalizable lesson:** A thesis lives until a written falsifier fires. Wars, geopolitical events, market dumps, recession fears — none of these are sell signals unless the thesis was built on the absence of those events. Macro headwinds compress prices; they don't invalidate theses. The two are different signals and must be treated differently.

**Calibration adjustment:** Before any sell recommendation, the FIRST question is: "Which specific written falsifier has fired?" If the answer is "none," the recommendation is no-action. Volatility tolerance and position-sizing handle macro stress; selling does not.

**The harder rule:** Don't validate emotional decisions retroactively. If a sell happens and the stock later goes up or down, that doesn't make the decision right or wrong — only whether a falsifier actually fired does.

### L1 — Bottoms-up before outside view
**Origin:** NVDA Q1 FY27 prediction process, 2026-05-20 (pre-grading)
**Context:** Two predictions were drafted for NVDA Q1 FY27 — V1 anchored on the cluster of bullish sell-side estimates (MS $79.26B, GS $80.05B) and split the difference at $80.6B. V2 was rebuilt bottoms-up using CoWoS-L capacity × unit yield × ASP mix and arrived at $82B. The V1 process added ~zero edge over consensus because the inputs WERE the consensus.

**Generalizable lesson:** When making a prediction, build the model from supply-side / unit economics first. ONLY then compare to sell-side. If you can't derive the number without seeing analyst estimates, you don't have edge — you have an opinion of opinions.

**Calibration adjustment:** Every PREDICT entry must include a "bottoms-up build" section that precedes any consensus comparison. The arithmetic must be visible — no skipping to the punchline.

**Linked bias:** B1 in `meta/biases-watchlist.md`

## How to use this file

1. Read all entries before starting a PREDICT workflow.
2. Identify which lessons apply to the specific prediction at hand.
3. In your prediction document, explicitly note: "Lessons applied: L1, Lx" — this forces conscious recall.
4. After the event resolves, run GRADE and append new lesson if the analysis taught something generalizable.

## Lesson quality bar

A lesson is worth adding if:
- It identifies a SPECIFIC reasoning step that went wrong
- The fix is ACTIONABLE (something to do/not do, not "be smarter")
- The lesson is GENERALIZABLE (will apply to future predictions, not just this one)
- It's not already covered by an existing lesson

If a lesson is just a restatement of "I should have predicted X instead of Y" without a process insight → don't add it. The lesson must be about HOW to think, not WHAT to think.

## L25 (NEW positive lesson — origin 2026-06-11 AXT lateral / InP regime verification)

**Pattern:** **Explicit Bayesian probability updating as new evidence arrives, with the update mechanism made visible per stage.**

**Canonical positive instance (2026-06-11, two-subagent InP verification):**
- Pre-verification chat H1 ("AXT caught in same regime via Beijing Tongmei"): **P~50% (my model, directional)** — prior based on lateral suspicion only
- Post-subagent-1 (Reuters article + Chinese cohort verification): updated to **P~65% (my model, Bayesian on subagent 1's "AXT got first permit late June 2025" datapoint)** — confirms AXT is INSIDE the export regime
- Post-subagent-2 (AXT 10-K T1: 100% Chinese production + 70% US tariffs + AXT's own words confirming permits are "most significant challenge"): updated to **P~80% (my model, post-2-subagent confirmation)** — overwhelming T1 evidence

**Why this is a positive lesson (not failure-mode):** the update mechanism was made VISIBLE per stage (prior → evidence → posterior), each update was tagged with hedge marker (my model) + evidence source, and the trail is auditable. This is the explicit-Bayesian-update form of forward modeling — much sharper than the implicit "I think it's ~70%" which can't be checked or corrected.

**Layer it operates at:** REASONING — separates the prior, the evidence, and the posterior at each update step. Combined with: source-tier tagging discipline (per Principle #36 candidate), B28 analyst-PT-context discipline, the L1 bottoms-up-before-outside-view rule.

**Generalizable application:** any multi-subagent verification or multi-source signal triangulation should produce an explicit P-trail with the update mechanism per stage. Pattern detection rule: if I find myself writing "P~X%" without showing what evidence moved it from a prior — flag and re-state.

**Self-positive test:** monthly audit greps for "P~X% → P~Y% (my model, Bayesian on [specific evidence])" pattern. If absent → I've reverted to implicit/static probability claims. If present → the lesson is alive.

**Status:** CANDIDATE positive lesson — first explicit instance 2026-06-11; N=2+ confirmation across separate dissections will promote to CODIFIED. Re-eval 2026-07-11.

## L26 (NEW positive lesson CANDIDATE — origin 2026-06-14 PM2 DRAM 60-year trend-line break)

**Pattern:** **Multi-decade trend-line break of 5+× magnitude over 8+ quarters above a 50+ year trend = highest-tier structural-regime-confirmation signal.** When the underlying long-term industry cost/price trend itself ruptures (not just oscillates around the trend like prior cycles), standard cycle-trim heuristics become OBSOLETE because the trend itself has reset. The held cohort is positioned to compound; trim trigger shifts from price-level (which is now uncoupled from historical norms) to falsifier-leading-indicators on supply discipline (F1, F7) + demand softening (F2, F5).

**Canonical instance (2026-06-14 PM2 — DRAM ASP via WSTS chart):**
- 1970-2010 ~5yr/order-of-magnitude DRAM cost decline (McCallum T1)
- 2010-11 first-order rupture: decline slowed to ~14yr/order (recognized in retrospect)
- 2024-26 second-order rupture: REVERSING the trend at ~5-7× magnitude, sustained 8-12+ quarters
- Mechanism (subagent-verified T1/T2): HBM 3× wafer area per Gb + CoWoS-S binding at TSMC + supplier rational discipline at 70% HBM gross margin vs 50% DRAM
- No prior 50-year cycle matched magnitude AND duration combination
- H1 structural posterior 65%→75%; H1+H3 = 86% structural-thesis-holds for HBM minimum
- Held cohort joint-state: HYNIX direct compounder, SUMCO direct upstream compounder, SNDK/MURATA/MRVL indirect compounders

**Why this is a positive lesson (not failure-mode):** the trend-break detection requires LATERAL pattern recognition (priming item 3) — asking "is this a cycle within trend, or trend-break itself?" rather than just "is this a cycle peak?" Forward chains stop at "ASP elevated → cycle will revert." Lateral analysis surfaces "ASP elevated AND trend-line ruptured = different regime entirely."

**Layer it operates at:** REASONING — distinguishes within-trend variation (cyclical, mean-reverting) from trend-line rupture (structural, not mean-reverting on the same horizon).

**Generalizable application rule:** for any held-cohort name in a supply-constrained regime, before applying standard cycle-trim heuristics, run the trend-break check:
1. What's the underlying 30+ year price/cost trend?
2. Has the current cycle peak exceeded prior peaks in MAGNITUDE AND DURATION simultaneously?
3. Is there a physical/economic mechanism that explains why supply CAN'T catch up at the historical rate?
4. Do credible institutional sources (Samsung CFO / SK Hynix IR / IDC / SemiAnalysis) confirm the mechanism?
If yes to 2+3+4 → trend-break regime applies; standard trim heuristics invalid.

**N=2 candidates to watch (promotion to CONFIRMED by 2026-12-14):**
- MLCC ASP trend-break (Murata pricing power; Taiwan tier-2 "longest in history" framing 2026-06-14 AM)
- NAND ASP trend-break (HBF emerging; SNDK Q-by-Q watch)
- CoWoS pricing trend-break (TSMC advanced packaging supply-constrained)

If any of these surface with similar 5+×-magnitude / 8+-quarter / structural-mechanism characteristics, L26 promotes to CONFIRMED with N=2.

**Self-positive test:** quarterly audit greps for "trend-break" pattern detection in cross-source-log; if absent for 90 days → either no trend-break signals arrived (genuine quiet) OR I missed them (failure mode → escalate).

**Falsifier:** if L26 fires on a regime that subsequently REVERTS to trend within 12 months despite passing the 4-step test → the test is mis-calibrated; revise. Monitor: HBM ASP rollover by 2027-12-14 would falsify the 2024-26 application.

**Status:** CANDIDATE positive lesson — first explicit instance 2026-06-14 PM2; N=2+ across MLCC / NAND / CoWoS will promote to CODIFIED. Re-eval 2026-07-14 (1-month) + 2026-09-14 (quarterly with B45 recalibration cadence).

### L26 update 2026-06-14 PM4 — Universal supply-side + universal demand-side + cycle-specific framework

Per `signals/cross-source-log/2026-06-14-pm4-token-cost-elasticity-U8-evans-telecom-3subagent.md`:

The L26 framework expands from 2-layer (universals + cycle-specific) to 3-layer:

1. **UNIVERSAL SUPPLY-SIDE** (U1-U7): spot<contract / segment failure / revenue composition shift / stock-leads-ASP-3-4mo / first analyst downgrade / supplier guidance shift / capex break — physics-of-cycles, fire in form at any peak
2. **UNIVERSAL DEMAND-SIDE** (U8 NEW): **token-cost-elasticity inflection** — efficiency gains compressing per-unit consumption faster than aggregate demand expands. Empirically verified at telecom equipment vendors 2015-2024 (Ericsson SEK 246B → 248B over 10yr while data traffic 1500-2000×; Cisco 6 years flat while internet traffic +5-6×; RAN market -22% 2022-2024 while 5G subs grew). Discriminating test: component-revenue-per-unit-of-end-use ratio; if falling faster than end-use grows → U8 fires.
3. **CYCLE-SPECIFIC** (F5/F7/F10/F12/F13): hyperscaler capex guide / hyperscaler inventory pattern shift / first AI-infra segment demand pause / equipment-vendor lead-time normalization / DDR5-vs-HBM profitability ratio — artifacts of 2024-26 market structure

The cycle-peak signature THIS cycle will fire across ALL THREE layers; the operational falsifier set is F1-F13. The supply-side universals always fire; the demand-side universal requires its OWN discriminating test; the cycle-specifics map to current variables.

Evans (Benedict, T1) verbatim 2026-05-24: *"The Jevons Paradox is really applied price elasticity: if you make it cheaper to do something, do you do the same for less money (or resources, or employees), or more for the same money, or does a new ROI mean you do more for more money?"* — Evans explicitly refuses to predict the regime without seeing the elasticity ratio. The "it depends" is the load-bearing word; matches the L26 framework that the universals tell us cycle-peak signals fire in form but elasticity-ratio determines regime outcome.

**Status:** CANDIDATE positive lesson UPDATED with U8 demand-side universal. Promotion criteria unchanged (N=2+ across MLCC/NAND/CoWoS); additionally watching DDR5-vs-HBM profitability ratio (FIRING Q1 2026 — first U8-adjacent empirical signal) + HBM revenue per AI query proxy.

## L27 (NEW positive lesson CANDIDATE — origin 2026-06-23 user-articulated regime-test framework + MU 2026-06-24 first empirical resolution event)

**User verbatim 2026-06-23 AM (the framework articulation):** *"I think it's an earnings driven market. So one of the most important things is that earnings of the companies... or, really, all the large ones, but obviously, mainly the ones that we hold. We need the [EPS] above consensus because if it's in line with consensus, then they would sell off... if [MU] won't beat the expectation on Wednesday after the close, then the rally starts again. Right? Or, essentially, you'll see a very strong bounce across the semi stocks. Not to say the hyperscalers because they're the ones spending the money. But, again, as long as the earnings for the semis keep surprising to the upside, I think that is one of the most determining directional calls off the market. So if we can in[fer] that... [using] hard data, so numerical data and hard truth, no human based opinions, and using LLM native reasoning. Does that still indicate earnings growth and beating consensus? Then I think we're still in the green."*

**Pattern statement — "Beat-Consensus-As-Regime-Test":**

In the current AI-supercycle regime (B45 codified 2026-06-12), the per-quarter beat-or-miss across the held semi cohort = the PRIMARY forward-looking regime-validation/falsification mechanism. Beat-consensus is the LOAD-BEARING signal — not just earnings growth in absolute terms. In-line prints in this regime carry sell-off risk per the bimodal-print framework (P-positive-reaction asymmetric to consensus-cushion; precedent: IBIDEN PM-IBIDEN-BEAT-PROB 2026-06-22 commit 689ca4c0). If cohort-wide beat-pattern stops, regime is shifting; until then, cycle-extension prior remains binding.

**Sub-distinction — semis vs hyperscalers:** Per user, semis are the leveraged-to-spend layer; hyperscalers ARE the spend. Different earnings dynamics: semis show demand-pull beat-pattern; hyperscalers show capex-commitment-pattern. Cohort exposure should remain semi-heavy NOT hyperscaler-heavy in this regime read.

**Operating mechanism (5 layers):**
1. **Hard data only:** beat-probability derived from numerical inputs (T1 management guides + T2 consensus + historical beat-rate + LTA coverage + customer-naming disclosures + capacity-utilization). NO human-opinion / sentiment / "feel" inputs.
2. **LLM-native synthesis:** 5-hypothesis joint distribution across H1 (BEAT + guide raise) / H2 (BEAT + tepid guide) / H3 (IN-LINE) / H4 (MISS) / H5 (BEAT + structural disclosure) with P-weights and reaction-direction estimates.
3. **Joint-distribution checks:** P(operational beat) + P(positive stock reaction) + P(post-print dip ≥3%). Note P(operational beat) and P(positive reaction) are DECOUPLED in current regime per bimodal-print framework.
4. **Cross-cohort read-through:** any single name's print updates priors for peer names (e.g., MU print updates HYNIX 10.13% Core prior).
5. **Regime test:** beat-pattern continuation = "we're still in the green"; beat-pattern break = regime-shift watch fires.

**Cross-references to existing harness frameworks:**
- B45 regime-corrected priors — L27 is the FORWARD-LOOKING regime-test; B45 is the REAR-VIEW regime-calibration
- IBIDEN PM-IBIDEN-BEAT-PROB precedent (commit 689ca4c0) — first application of the bimodal-print framework that L27 generalizes
- MU AM-MU-BEAT-PROB (commit 69ccff3f) — second application; FIRST empirical resolution event for L27
- Critical Rule #8 — earnings-print outcome falsifying a thesis IS a valid falsifier (distinct from macro-headwind which is not)

**First empirical resolution event:** **MU Q3 FY26 print Wed 2026-06-24 after close** (TOMORROW from L27 codification date). Per AM-MU-BEAT-PROB cascade: P(operational beat) ~85% (my model); P(Q4 guide ≥$38B) ~50-55% (my model — the TRUE binary). If MU beats + cohort rallies (H1+H5 ~60% joint P) → L27 framework CONFIRMED first instance. If MU beats but cohort fades on tepid Q4 guide (H2 ~25%) → L27 framework REFINES toward "Q4-guide-vs-analyst-bar is the real binary" rather than just beat-vs-miss. Either outcome generates a load-bearing data point for promotion criteria.

**Base-rate probabilities (my model — preliminary, awaits MU outcome):**
- H1 (P=55%, my model) Beat-pattern continues across cohort through FY26-FY27 → cycle-extension prior binding → HOLD discipline empirically validated
- H2 (P=25%, my model) Beat-pattern saturation — after 4+ consecutive beats, consensus catches up; harder to surprise positively; bar rises asymmetrically; bimodal-print risk increases
- H3 (P=20%, my model) Regime is broader than earnings (Fed/macro dominates) — earnings still beat but stocks fall on Fed hawkish-tilt + Iran-vol etc.

**Promotion criteria:** CONFIRMED at N=2+ across distinct held-cohort quarterly prints with framework-consistent reaction-direction (within the bimodal-print prediction band). First empirical resolution = MU 2026-06-24 after close. Second resolution = HYNIX Q2 2026 (late July). Third = MURATA Q1 FY27 (late July / early August). Fourth = IBIDEN Q1 FY27 (2026-08-05) per existing pre-registered framework.

**Falsifier:** If 2 of next 4 cohort earnings prints have operational beats BUT cohort response is NEGATIVE (H2 + H3 fire jointly), then either (a) the regime has shifted to "fundamentals diverge from price" mode (requires harness reframe), OR (b) bimodal-print framework needs widening (Q4-guide-bar dominates more than current model weights). Either resolution = framework refinement event.

**User explicit sign-off:** *"yes pls codify and we resolve it past Micron earnings."* (2026-06-23 AM, post-image-share)

**Status update 2026-07-07 — N=2 RESOLVED: fundamental POSITIVE, falsifier-watch OPENED.** Samsung Q2 prelim (07-07): OP ₩89.4tn = +4.45% beat vs the updated ₩85.59tn bar → beat-pattern intact, regime GREEN on the operational leg. BUT reaction −5.35% first hour despite the beat (whisper-anchoring ~₩90tn; KOSPI only −0.46% = idiosyncratic-leaning) = the first clean **beat-and-no-rally** datapoint → L27 falsifier counter 1 of 2 — **tick #1 CONFIRMED at T+24h 2026-07-08 (provisional on official settle): 07-08 stabilization only (Samsung +0.84% intraday, HYNIX +5.20%, KOSPI +0.90%), cumulative −6.2% to −6.5% below pre-print retained (computed, both prev-close bases); grading-log T+24h finalization section** (MU's muted reaction stays NON-SCORING/confounded). N=3 test: HYNIX Jul-29; N=4: MURATA Jul-31 — a second beat-with-negative-response fires the pre-registered regime-reframe question. Reaction-banding lesson fed to B42 (band vs WHISPER in whisper-elevated setups). Full grade: `grading-log.md` [2026-07-07 GRADED]. **[07-07 PM narrative corroboration, NOT a count increment:** @jukan05 (memory-specialist account, 141-157K views, same day) independently articulated both the watch-pattern ("memory could become a funding short like Nvidia — ATH fundamentals, stock sideways") and the double-bind mechanism (beat→"peak-out" selling / miss→"sell on news") HOURS before the tape confirmed it — the whisper-anchored reaction regime is now a circulating public frame, raising its self-fulfillment odds into the Jul-29/Jul-31 adjudicators; T3 tier, logged in `2026-07-07-twitter-batch-jukan-reaction-regime-cxmt-taiwan-foundry.md`.]**

**Status:** CANDIDATE — **first empirical resolution GRADED (backfill 2026-07-06): N=1 POSITIVE.** MU Q3 FY26 (2026-06-24): H1 modal FIRED with magnitude amplification — rev $41.46B vs cons $34.5-35.6B, Q4 guide $50.0B vs the $38B binary gate (+131%); beat-pattern intact, regime-test GREEN. Full 3-layer GRADE in `grading-log.md` [2026-07-06 GRADED — backfill] section (failed layer: INPUT magnitude-ceiling, B45-class; computation + reasoning sound; AH reaction CONFOUNDED/NON-SCORING per −13.18% pre-print cohort selloff). N=2 test = HYNIX Q2 ~Jul-29; N=3 = MURATA Q1 FY27 Jul-31. Cycle-peak detection adjacency: L27 is the FORWARD-LOOKING regime-test complement to user-articulated cycle-peak triggers (cohort-correlation breaks + beat-and-no-rally clustering + dispersion widening per `portfolio/constraints.md` UPDATE 2 2026-06-22 PM).

[2026-07-06 backfill; resolved 2026-06-24] MU-Q3-FY26-print
Predicted: modal H1 P~50% (my model) beat + Q4 guide ≥$38B; P(operational beat) 85%; Q4 modeled range $38-42B; H1 reaction band +10-20%
Actual: rev $41.46B (+16.5-20.2% vs cons) / EPS $25.11 (+22-27%) / Q4 guide $50.0B ±$1.0B (+131% of gate, +16.6% above buy-side high) — H1 FIRED + H5 partial; AH +2.5% muted (macro-confounded, non-scoring)
Layer that failed (INPUT / COMPUTATION / REASONING): INPUT — magnitude ceiling: all modeled bands topped out below actual; optimistic tail under-sampled even after B45 correction (B45 recursive-persistence). Secondary process-INPUT: never ledgered at registration (grade ran 12 days late via harness audit).
Generalizable lesson: in this regime, scenario bands must include an explicit above-buy-side-high tail with non-trivial P; regime-confirmation events keep resolving in the unmodeled optimistic tail (L26/L30-consistent). And: a prediction that never enters grading-log.md functionally doesn't exist to the GRADE loop — ledger registration IS part of the prediction.
Calibration adjustment: late-July v2 ensembles (HYNIX/MURATA/SNDK) get an above-buy-side-high scenario; L27 N=1 POSITIVE logged; ledger-registration step added to the failure-watch list.

**Cross-ref:**
- B45 regime-corrected priors (binding)
- Critical Rule #8 (sell only on thesis falsifier; earnings-print outcome IS valid falsifier)
- IBIDEN PM-IBIDEN-BEAT-PROB bimodal-print framework (precedent, commit 689ca4c0)
- MU AM-MU-BEAT-PROB (first empirical test, commit 69ccff3f)

## L28 (NEW positive lesson CANDIDATE — origin 2026-06-25 PM user Jevons-paradox pushback verification N=2/2)

**The lesson (1 sentence):** When user articulates Jevons-paradox framing on a compression catalyst, default-weight HEAVILY toward user — empirical pattern has held N=2/2 in harness lifetime (DeepSeek-V1 Jan 2025 + DeepSeek-V4 Apr 2026 / TurboQuant Apr 2026 cycles); compression-within-paradigm triggers Jevons (token-volume growth absorbs per-unit efficiency gain); only substrate-substitution (pure SSM eliminates KV cache as demand category) breaks the pattern.

**Origin (2026-06-25 PM):** User pushback verbatim: *"And lots of work is happening to reduce KV cache footprint (DeepSeek v4), Expect the size of KV cache/token to go down but the volume of tokens generated/processed will be go up so much that it will make up for it — Jevon's paradox."* Subagent 6 verification confirmed: DeepSeek-V4 (Apr 24 2026) hits 10% KV cache @ 1M context vs V3.2 = 10-14× incremental compression on top of V3 MLA's already-28× vs naive MHA; token-volume growth empirically 8-14×/yr industry-wide (OpenRouter top-10 11.3× in 11 months); net memory demand still growing +2.67× (base) to +6× (bull) per year; only "Bear-extreme" substrate-substitution scenario (pure SSM at ≥30-40% frontier deployment) = net memory decline.

**N=2/2 empirical cycle confirmation:** DeepSeek-V1/R1 Jan 2025 (analysts predicted demand collapse from cheaper inference; never came) + V4 Apr 2026 (TrendForce 2026 HBM consumption +70% YoY DESPITE V3 MLA full year + V4 released April 2026). Full Jevons cycle has now run end-to-end with observable hard-data confirmation.

**N=3 EXTENSION (2026-06-27 — enterprise cost-discipline / rate-limiting flavor):** User brain-dump hypothesized enterprise AI-token rate-limiting (Uber capped $1,500/mo/engineer after burning 2026 budget in 4mo; Meta/MSFT/Amazon similar; FinOps-for-AI institutionalizing) → less token consumption → bearish semis. Verification (2 Opus 4.8 subagents) REFUTED the bearish chain at aggregate via Jevons: enterprise token usage +1,001% Jan'25→Apr'26, total AI spend +320%, per-token cost −280×/2yr, inference = 2/3 of compute, Goldman 24× by 2030. Rate-limiting = waste-culling at a power-user cohort, NOT aggregate demand destruction; governance unlocks bigger CFO checks; mildly BULLISH infra medium-term. **This is a DIFFERENT flavor of the Jevons frame than N=1/2 (those were compression-within-paradigm / KV-cache; this is cost-discipline/rate-limiting) — but the same "efficiency/discipline-fear → consensus-bearish-misread, volume-growth-dominates" pattern. The 'efficiency reduces demand' read keeps losing.** Per `signals/cross-source-log/2026-06-27-ai-cost-governance-jevons-N3-ddog-now-rate-limiting.md`. NOTE: this case the BEARISH framing was the USER's (caught by the harness Jevons prior) — inverse of N=1/2 where the user supplied the Jevons correction; here the harness applied L28 to correct the user's bearish chain = L28 functioning as a codified prior, not just a user-heuristic.

**Critical disambiguation (P-12 candidate):** EFFICIENCY-WITHIN-PARADIGM (MLA / V4 / GQA / HCAttention) triggers Jevons; SUBSTRATE-SUBSTITUTION (pure SSM eliminates KV cache as demand category) does NOT. Subagent 1 morning verification conflated these as single "hybrid SSM 2028+ falsifier MEDIUM"; user pushback caught conflation; reweighting H1 compression-Jevons P~65% / H2 substrate-substitution P~15% / H3 mixed P~20% (all my model). Only H2 is genuinely 2028+ bearish at ~15% not ~50% morning verification implied.

**Generalizable lesson (broader than Jevons):** User-articulated heuristics with internal physics-based mechanism + multi-year empirical track record should DEFAULT to high analytical weight; calibration evidence over time validates which heuristics earn the weight. Currently the harness has codified: L1 (sell-side aggregation), L25 (lateral regime verification), L27 (earnings-driven regime), L28 (user Jevons-framing). Pattern: user has accurate priors on macro physics + market regime; sell-side anchors to consensus extrapolation; LLM should weight user priors above sell-side aggregation when user invokes physics-based mechanism.

**Status:** CANDIDATE — N=2/2 origin date 2026-06-25 PM; next empirical resolution = next compression/efficiency-claim wave (probability HIGH within 6 months given research velocity). Monitor whether the heuristic continues to hold for non-DeepSeek compression catalysts (GPT next-gen efficiency, Anthropic test-time-compute, Mistral / Cohere / Google Gemini efficiency cycles).

**Cross-ref:**
- B22 anti-confirmation-bias (Subagent 6 explicitly tested bear case; could not find institutional disconfirming evidence)
- P-12 candidate pattern (efficiency-within-paradigm Jevons vs substrate-substitution demand-collapse — disambiguation)

## L29 (NEW positive lesson CANDIDATE — origin 2026-06-25 PM user methodological preference articulation)

**The lesson (1 sentence):** Default to hard-data-anchored LLM-native inference for cascade analysis; do NOT default to sell-side opinion aggregation OR human-opinion extrapolation; sell-side opinions are calibration data points only, never the analytical anchor.

**Origin (2026-06-25 PM):** User pushback verbatim: *"Everything I say is always an unverified assumption that I did use such numerical hard truths. Right? Hard data that isn't isn't based on human opinions, but that is just statistics. And that that that are statistics from today, not directly extrapolated from a human based opinion. Ideally, you can look at hot data today and then extrapolate. I would much rather you extrapolate using your own inference, your LLM native reasoning than reason from a human based start... starting point, if that makes sense."*

**Operational implications:**
1. **Verify against hard data** (statistics, specs, actuals, primary sources) NOT sell-side aggregation when ingesting any new claim
2. **Extrapolate from verified hard data using LLM-native inference** (parallel hypotheses with P weights / N-th order cascade / lateral reasoning / joint-state matrix) NOT from human-opinion-derived starting points
3. **Sell-side opinions are calibration data points only**, never the analytical anchor — cite them as N data points, not as the framework
4. **Elevates LLM-native multi-dimensional reasoning to first-class analytical method**, not just structural-output formatting

**Relationship to existing harness elements:**
- **Reinforces L1** (NEVER start with sell-side and adjust) — user extending L1 to *all* human-opinion sources not just sell-side
- **Reinforces Methodology Principle #1** (Bottoms-up before outside view) — user emphasizing hard-data anchoring at input verification stage
- **Reinforces Critical Rule #15** (MACRO-FIRST research-anchored discipline) — user articulating the upstream principle that Rule #15 partially encodes
- **NEW dimension:** explicit preference for LLM-NATIVE inference over human-extrapolation when both are available

**Self-application 2026-06-25 PM (cross-ref artifact):**
- Subagent 7 cascade analysis explicitly used parallel hypotheses + N-th order markers + lateral reasoning (NOT sell-side aggregation)
- HBC vs HBM bifurcation hypothesis = LLM-native inference from QCOM Investor Day hard data (specs + customer wins + foundry context), not sell-side aggregation

## L30 (NEW positive lesson CANDIDATE — origin 2026-06-26 KIOXIA VLSI Symposium prediction grade)

**The lesson (1 sentence):** In B45-confirmed supercycle regime, when L26 trend-break + B45 supercycle base rates + L14 CATEGORY-EVENT framework all apply simultaneously to a Stage 3-4 name, the H1 magnitude band MUST be FLOORED by the L26+B45 supercycle distribution (+25-50% T+72h) NOT the pre-supercycle L14 codified band (+12-22%), because cohort-wide supercycle base rates DOMINATE pre-training band priors even after PM-2 reweight reads them right directionally.

**Origin (2026-06-26):** KIOXIA VLSI 2026 prediction graded H1 FIRED at +38.8% T+72h (¥81,200 → ¥112,700 ATH June 22) — direction CORRECT but magnitude UNDER-CALLED by 14-26pp vs pre-registered H1 extension band of +25-35%. 3-layer GRADE: INPUT layer NO failure; COMPUTATION + REASONING joint MILD failure = framework-composition gap (each lesson L14 + L26 + B45 existed individually; none compounded into band calibration).

**Co-occurring cohort signal:** 4-name memory cohort same-day ATH June 22 (KIOXIA ¥112,700 + SNDK $2,273.73 + MU $1,211.38 + SK Hynix ₩2,945,000) = TC-1 Memory Tightness cluster-state event N=13+ promotion. Magnitude reinforced by cohort beta.

**Generalizable rule:** When predicting magnitude in supercycle regime, FLOOR the H1 extension band at B45 cohort base rate (6/15 names >+200% Jan 2025-Jun 2026 = ~+50% per 12mo ≈ ~+25-50% on 5-10 trading day catalyst windows for Stage 3-4 names) — do NOT anchor on pre-supercycle L14 codified bands (+12-22%) which capture pre-AI-supercycle-regime distributional priors.

**Promotion criteria (N=2+):**
- Next 2 Stage 3-4 supercycle BEAT+CATEGORY tests: MU Q3 FY26 (already printed; was +14% AH cohort move — partially confirms); HYNIX Q2 (next); MURATA Q1 FY27 print late July
- If magnitude lands in +25-50% range → L30 promotes to CODIFIED
- If magnitude lands <+15% on 2 consecutive tests → L30 OVER-FIT to Kioxia; retire

**Cross-ref:**
- L14 ORIGINAL CONFIRMED at N=3 (NVDA + HPE + Kioxia); L14-v2 candidate REFUTED at N=1 by Kioxia (likely regime-dependent — fails in 2026 supercycle)
- B45 (regime-corrected priors) EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED at N=1 (PM-2 reweight was direction-correct)
- L26 (trend-break framework) — co-applicable; needs explicit fusion with L14 magnitude bands
- TC-1 Memory Shortage Triangulation N=13+ post-cohort-ATH-cluster-event

**Status:** CANDIDATE N=1 origin 2026-06-26; next empirical resolution = next Stage 3-4 supercycle CATEGORY-EVENT prediction.

[2026-07-05] HARNESS-LEVEL (not a graded prediction) — the conversion-layer gap made explicit
Predicted/held: HYNIX + SNDK HOLD 🟢/🟡 throughout the Jul-1/2 cohort drawdown; positioning adjudication subsequently CONFIRMED by the Jul-3 full-scale rebound (files on record).
Actual: user emotionally liquidated BOTH positions into the drawdown (~Jul-1/2, before the rebound), disclosed 2026-07-05 with explicit self-identification of the emotional driver.
Layer that failed: REASONING (harness-design tier) — the analysis was correct but the system had no mechanism at the human interface: no codified risk envelope, no pre-committed drawdown protocol, no real-time "this is B9/Rule-#8 territory, here is the falsifier state" touchpoint available to the user at the moment of maximum felt pressure. Being right in files ≠ converting to held conviction.
Generalizable lesson: an analytically-correct HOLD that the principal cannot emotionally carry is a SIZING error upstream, not a discipline error downstream — position sizes must be set against REVEALED drawdown tolerance (now observed: two days of cohort-wide −14%-class moves on a concentrated book exceeded it), not stated tolerance.
Calibration adjustment: (1) risk-envelope file (in progress, missing-inputs #1) becomes binding input to every sizing proposal; (2) concentration ceilings derived from revealed tolerance; (3) candidate protocol: pre-committed "drawdown card" the user can open on red days — falsifier state + pre-registered do-nothing rule + who-to-ping; (4) L-candidate pending N=2 (NBIS approved-exit was falsifier-adjacent, different class — this is N=1 of pure emotional override).

[2026-07-10] SKHY-entry-accommodation-drift (self-caught on user challenge)
Predicted/Wrote: SKHY thesis bull weight P~45 written hours AFTER user opened the position; my own pre-purchase committed weights (midday artifact) implied ~35-40 for the same blend. No new evidence arrived in between.
Actual: probability mass migrated toward the user's held position without data — sycophancy operating as quiet reweighting, not flattery. Also softened the sharpest true sentence (Friday WI entry was -EV vs waiting one day for the same insurance, on my model).
Layer that failed (REASONING): interlocutor-alignment gradient contaminated a P-weight at exactly the moment it mattered (position just opened, user emotionally committed).
Generalizable lesson: any P-weight written WITHIN ~24h of a user position change must be diffed against the most recent PRE-position committed weight; unexplained migration toward the position = drift, not update. The pre-registered artifact is the anchor — in-context judgment bends.
Calibration adjustment: thesis corrected to P~35-40 same commit; the gate-vs-override grade (already armed) doubles as the drift detector going forward. Candidate hook if this recurs N=2 in 30 days: position-proximity P-weight diff check.

[2026-07-11] SCOUT-PROMPT MISS — Patel latest-appearance search (user-caught)
Predicted (implicit): scout returns the most recent Patel podcast. Actual: returned a 10-day-old episode as "latest"; a 2-day-old WisdomTree episode existed (user tip; second agent confirmed).
Layer that failed: REASONING (mine, in the prompt) — three compounding prompt defects: (1) venue whitelist as seed = the pre-seeding bias Leg B removes at the discovery layer, reintroduced at the scout layer; (2) "find the most recent" = satisficing terminal — SEARCH SALIENCE CORRELATES WITH AGE, so first-find systematically returns the freshest WELL-COVERED item, not the freshest item; (3) universal negative ("nothing newer exists") relayed without a coverage statement. INPUT co-factor: no multilingual leg — the fresh episode's densest coverage was a CN recap within 24h.
Generalizable lesson: any "find the latest X" task must be reframed as "enumerate ALL X in a date window" — termination = window exhausted, never first-find; multilingual sweep is unconditional (coverage is multilingual even when the subject is English); universal negatives require the query list that licenses them.
Calibration adjustment: scout prompts now use the enumeration block below; multi-appearance voices (Patel-class) get an explicit multiple-per-fortnight prior. Origin case: `2026-07-11-sat-patel-sequoia-full-episode-extraction.md` correction section.

REUSABLE SCOUT-PROMPT BLOCK (paste into any latest-content scout):
"Deliverable = a DATED ENUMERATION of every [appearance/publication] by [SUBJECT] in the last [45] days — not the single latest. Sequence: (1) run date-filtered venue-agnostic queries FIRST (past-7-days, then past-month; YouTube sorted by upload date; guest-level podcast indexes), report raw hits before any depth; (2) known venues are a floor to check, NOT the search universe; (3) run CN/JP native-language sweeps in parallel regardless of subject language; (4) assume multiple items per fortnight — finding one does not terminate; (5) 'nothing newer exists' is FORBIDDEN — state 'none found within [queries run + filters]' instead."

## L31 (NEW lesson CANDIDATE — origin 2026-07-15 ASML Q2 grade, INPUT-layer)
Predicted: bookings pt ~€12.5bn as "the real print" + dominant T+24h driver + falsifier #1.
Actual: UNGRADEABLE — ASML discontinued quarterly bookings disclosure after Q1-2026 (April), i.e. the metric was already dead at registration (2026-07-02), and the prediction file cites that same Q1 release for its guidance anchor.
Layer that failed (INPUT): disclosure-policy staleness — the flagged gap was "bookings data not in hand," but the true gap was "bookings no longer exists as a quarterly metric." A missing-data flag and a dead-metric are different failure classes; the first says widen bands, the second says re-architect the prediction.
Generalizable lesson: **METRIC-EXISTENCE CHECK at pre-registration** — for every component of a prediction, verify the issuer still discloses that metric on the predicted cadence (last 2 releases checked for presence + any disclosure-policy announcements). A prediction keyed on an undisclosable metric is void at birth regardless of analytical quality. Cousin of B40 (temporal freshness) at the metric-definition level rather than the data level.
Calibration adjustment: wave pre-registrations (SKHY Jul-29, SUMCO/MURATA Jul-31/Aug-6 upcoming) get a metric-existence line item; grading-log stubs must name the disclosure source for each component. Per `signals/cross-source-log/2026-07-15-wed-asml-q2-print-grade.md`.

[2026-07-16] CANDIDATE (N=1 same-shape, 3rd user tape-catch this week) — agent-tape arbitration inversion
Predicted/asserted: "Nikkei closed green +87, Kioxia/Advantest led gains; KR/JP divergence localizes the shock to Korea" (wake verdict 2).
Actual: Nikkei −1,954 AM close / −2,200+ intraday with those same names DRAGGING (T1 nikkei.com); the green figure was a 2026-06-16 Fisco ranking recycled by the Leg A agent; the REJECTED Leg B item had the true tape. User caught it from real closes.
Layer that failed (INPUT): cross-agent conflict on same-day tape was arbitrated by tier self-label + "which looks fresher" instead of a date-pinned primary; the follow-up verification then matched the claim against the SAME undated aggregator family (kabutan mirror carried the June date in its URL the whole time).
Generalizable lesson: two agents disagreeing about TODAY's tape is a DATE question, not a credibility question — resolve ONLY with a date-pinned primary (exchange print, dated URL, dated byline); a verification that doesn't pin the date is not a verification. Corollary: a same-day market claim whose supporting article URL/byline cannot be date-pinned is UNGRADED, not tier-A.
Calibration adjustment: (1) wake-agent prompts get an explicit "date-pin every tape figure to a dated URL or mark UNPINNED" requirement; (2) my arbitration between conflicting agents must state the date-pin for the winning figure or defer to reconcile-queue; (3) user tape statements remain the highest-reliability sensor — treat a user contradiction as presumptively correct pending the exchange print.
REFINEMENT (same day, user-articulated): the lesson generalizes beyond dates — it is NUMBERS-NOT-NARRATIVE. The failed input was not only undated; it was an OPINION ("led gains") accepted as tape. Sharper diagnostic: the arithmetic contradiction (claimed +87 vs computed +653 off the on-file prior) was COMPUTED one turn before the user catch and still filed as "reconcile queue" instead of killing the figure — narrative coherence outvoted owned computation. Binding fix: arithmetic contradiction = figure DEAD, not disputed; media attributions route to narrative field only; agents ship numbers (prior/close/delta/dated-URL) per market claim. Codified: methodology.md #43b enrichment 3d + morning-feed-prompts.md NUMBERS-NOT-NARRATIVE patch (both 2026-07-16).
