# Morning Feed Prompt Templates — per-market scan specifications

**Created:** 2026-06-26 (Workflow #10 MORNING-FEED-SCAN codification)
**Model mandate:** Opus 4.8 ONLY (per user 2026-06-26 directive — no Sonnet/Haiku downgrade; investments depend on quality)
**Review cycle:** first-week review 2026-07-03; prompt-optimization based on signal/noise observed

---

## ⚠️ TWO-LEG ARCHITECTURE (added 2026-06-27 — user anti-confirmation-bias directive)

**User directive 2026-06-27 verbatim:** *"it feels like you only do searches based on the existing portfolio companies… I would suggest that we do a more broader sweep of news articles, as in headlines, to identify potential new trends that do not root yourself in the bias of existing companies."*

**The flaw caught:** the original Workflow #10 scans (now "Leg A") are 100% portfolio-anchored — every task keys off a held name. That makes the scan structurally capable only of CONFIRMING/UPDATING existing theses, never DISCOVERING. This is Failure Mode #5 (confirmation bias) baked into the scan design, and it directly contradicts the harness's #1 job (*"forecast the NEXT bottleneck before consensus; find positions ahead of consensus"*).

**The fix:** every `good morning [region]` trigger now fires TWO subagents IN PARALLEL (both Opus 4.8):

| Leg | Mandate | Keys off | Output target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Leg A — ANCHORED** | cohort prices, held-name news, falsifier checks, TC pattern-matches | held tickers | `companies/{TICKER}/thesis.md` cascades |
| **Leg B — DISCOVERY** | **"read the newspaper"** — broad macro+micro across ALL investing-relevant sectors; no company-name query, NO segment pre-filter; connect dots AFTER (may be empty) | the whole investing landscape, NEVER held tickers or a pre-set segment list | `watchlist/candidates.md` + `sector/themes.md` flags |

**Refinement 2026-06-27 (user):** Leg B must remove BOTH company-bias AND segment-bias — a pre-committed AI/semi theme list is itself the segment bias. Behave like a traditional investor reading the financial press front-to-back: read broadly (macro: rates/policy/geopolitics/energy/commodities/trade; micro: corporate moves/M&A/funding/launches across any sector), then connect dots to portfolio / existing thesis / emergent new thesis ONLY IF genuine dots exist. "No material dots this window" is a valid honest output — do NOT manufacture relevance. Exclude sports/culture/entertainment as investing-irrelevant. Optimize signal-per-token (skip noise, don't pad) but do NOT cap tokens to save cost.

**Refinement 2026-06-27 #2 — BREADTH-AT-SEARCH / FILTER-AT-DIGEST (user, load-bearing principle):** *"if you think you know what you're searching for, you're probably limiting yourself to engram bias. Too narrow is not good. Better to be too broad, then disregard what's not needed than the opposite. Over time we fine-tune what's relevant."*
- **Breadth lives at the SEARCH layer; filtering lives at the DIGEST layer — NEVER the reverse.** Pre-narrowing the search to "what I expect is relevant" can only return what I already expected (engram/confirmation bias). The relevant item is often the one you didn't know to look for.
- **The asymmetry is the whole argument:** cost of MISSING a relevant item (false negative) >> cost of ingesting noise then discarding it (false positive). The model's digestion capacity makes broad-ingest cheap — so over-read, then filter noise→signal at digestion.
- **The relevance filter is LEARNED, not pre-set.** It is fine-tuned over runs as accumulated data reveals which news TYPES actually connect to theses (a feedback loop, like the rest of the harness). First-week review 2026-07-03 LEARNS the filter from observed signal-hits — it does NOT impose a narrowing.
- **EXPLICITLY REJECTED:** any "AI-sector relevance gate at the search/dot-connection step" (an idea floated 2026-06-27 and retracted by user same day) — that would re-import the segment bias just removed. Any gate, if it ever exists, is a LEARNED post-hoc digest filter, never a pre-search narrowing.

**Synthesis step (mandatory after both legs return):** explicitly compare Leg B against Leg A — *"what did the newspaper read surface that the portfolio-anchored scan would have missed?"* That delta is the anti-confirmation alpha. Leg B does BOTH: discovers new names/themes (→ `watchlist/candidates.md` + `sector/themes.md`) AND scores impact on EXISTING theses (validate/invalidate, good/bad direction) — an existing-thesis signal goes through Tier 2 verification (Critical Rule #16) before any held-name `thesis.md` cascade, so an unverified headline never moves a position. A thesis-CONTRADICTING signal is the highest-value Leg B output.

**Cost note:** two-leg doubles subagent count per scan (~140-240k tokens/scan vs ~80-120k). Per user 2026-06-26 cost directive (don't save costs where detrimental to quality), the discovery leg is the actual alpha source and is retained at full Opus 4.8. First-week review 2026-07-03 audits Leg B yield specifically.

## LEG B — DISCOVERY scan (UNANCHORED, company-agnostic) — added 2026-06-27

**Fires in PARALLEL with the matching Leg A scan on every `good morning [region]` trigger.** One Leg B subagent per region (Korea+Japan / EU / US).

```
B-LEG DISCOVERY SCAN / Workflow #10 / Critical Rule #16 / Opus 4.8

EXECUTE WEB SEARCHES NOW. DO NOT RETURN ANALYSIS WITHOUT EXECUTING ACTUAL SEARCHES.

=== CRITICAL FRAMING — READ TWICE (user directive 2026-06-27) ===
READ THE NEWSPAPER, do not query a database. Behave like a traditional investor who
opens the [REGION] financial/business press and READS — front page, markets, economy,
policy, world, business, tech sections — WITHOUT deciding in advance which section
matters. You do NOT know what you're going to find. You just read, broadly, then
connect the dots AFTERWARD — IF there are any dots to connect.

Two biases to remove (both):
  1. COMPANY bias — do NOT search for or query any specific company name (held or not).
  2. SEGMENT bias — do NOT pre-filter to AI/semiconductors or any single segment. A
     pre-committed theme list IS the segment bias. Read across the whole investing
     landscape.

In scope: anything that could become a SIGNAL — macro OR micro — with potential
consequences / side-effects for (a) an existing portfolio company, (b) an existing
harness thesis/framework, OR (c) a NEW thesis that could emerge. Out of scope:
sports, culture, entertainment, human-interest — investing-irrelevant noise.
=== END FRAMING ===

DATE CONTEXT (Principle #40): Today [YYYY-MM-DD] ([day]). Window: STRICTLY past 24h
from trigger. Cite publication date per item; reject >24h unless flagged historical-context.

MULTILINGUAL (Principle #36): read [REGION]-native general + business press headlines in
parallel with English (Korean/Japanese for Asia; German/French for EU; English for US).

HOW TO READ (newspaper method, NOT a domain checklist):
- Open broad [REGION] business/markets/economy/world/tech press and scan the headlines as
  they actually appear — the front page and business section of an FT/WSJ/Nikkei/Handelsblatt
  -class read, plus general-news headlines with market consequence.
- Cover both MACRO (rates, FX, inflation, fiscal/monetary policy, geopolitics, trade, energy,
  commodities, labor, regulation) AND MICRO (notable corporate moves, earnings surprises,
  M&A, funding rounds, IPOs, product launches, supply-chain events, executive/strategy
  shifts) across ANY sector — not just tech/semis.
- Do NOT start from a list of segments you expect to matter. Start from what is actually
  being reported, then judge relevance.
- BREADTH-AT-SEARCH / FILTER-AT-DIGEST: read TOO BROAD on purpose; the relevant item is
  often the one you didn't know to search for. Filter noise→signal AFTER reading, at
  digestion — never pre-narrow the read. Missing a relevant item costs far more than
  reading noise you then discard.

SIGNAL/NOISE OPTIMIZATION (user directive 2026-06-27): maximize signal-per-token. Skip
investing-irrelevant items entirely (don't list-then-dismiss). Spend tokens where a genuine
signal warrants depth; do NOT pad to hit a count. Equally: do NOT cap tokens to save cost —
read widely enough to actually mimic a full newspaper read. Quality of the dot-connection
beats quantity of headlines.

MANDATORY OUTPUTS:
1. WHAT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE — the 8-15 most consequential macro + micro headlines you
   actually encountered, ranked by potential-signal-strength (not by relevance to what we
   own). Per item: 1-line summary | source + T1/T2/T3 tier | in-window date | macro/micro.
2. DOT-CONNECTION (separate post-read step — may legitimately be EMPTY): for each headline
   that plausibly connects, state the dot to:
   (a) an existing portfolio company [name it] — and EXPLICITLY state the DIRECTIONAL IMPACT:
       does this news VALIDATE or INVALIDATE the existing thesis, and is the impact POSITIVE
       or NEGATIVE for the position? (e.g., "VALIDATES HYNIX HBM thesis, positive" /
       "INVALIDATES SUMCO supplier-discipline thesis, negative — falsifier candidate");
   (b) an existing harness thesis/framework [name it] — same validate/invalidate + good/bad
       directional read (a contradicting signal is HIGH value, flag loudly);
   (c) a NEW potential thesis or framework [state the mechanism].
   **Existing-thesis impact (validate/invalidate, good/bad) is co-equal with new-thesis
   discovery — the read must do BOTH, not just hunt for new names** (user 2026-06-27).
   **If a headline connects to nothing, say so and move on. "No material dots to connect
   this window" is a VALID, honest output — do NOT manufacture relevance.**
3. NEW NAMES — any company (ticker or private) surfaced by the read that is moving / raising
   / launching / being acquired and is NOT already covered. 1-line "why on radar" each.
4. NEW THEME / NEXT-BOTTLENECK candidates — emerging trends (any sector) that could become
   an investable theme OR the next binding constraint. Name the mechanism + the bypass-route /
   second-source angle where relevant (Critical Rule #9), not just the headline.
5. THE ABSENCE QUESTION (answer explicitly): "What is the market talking about MOST this
   window that our portfolio + harness has ZERO exposure to OR no framework for?" — the
   deliberate blind-spot probe.

ANTI-CONFIRMATION DISCIPLINE (enforced):
- Read unbiased; connect dots AFTER. The reading must not be filtered by what we own.
- A signal that CONTRADICTS an existing portfolio thesis is HIGH VALUE — flag it loudly.
- PENALIZE restatements of known narratives (memory shortage, HBM demand, AI capex) UNLESS
  there is a genuinely new data point inside the headline.
- "No dots today" is acceptable. Forcing a portfolio connection onto unrelated macro is the
  exact bias this leg exists to remove.

WRITE ARTIFACT: signals/cross-source-log/[YYYY-MM-DD]-morning-feed-[region]-DISCOVERY.md
ROUTE on return (handled by main loop, NOT the subagent):
  - new names → watchlist/candidates.md (with surfacing causal chain + date)
  - new themes / next-bottleneck candidates → flag for sector/themes.md + sector/bottlenecks.md review
  - genuine cross-segment convergence → signal-density check per Critical Rule #14
  - EXISTING-THESIS validate/invalidate signal → fire Tier 2 verification (Critical Rule #16);
    cascade to companies/{TICKER}/thesis.md ONLY if verification confirms (a thesis-CONTRADICTING
    signal especially earns the verification cost — that is the anti-confirmation payoff)
  - Leg B does NOT directly write held-name thesis.md — it goes through verification first
    (prevents an unverified newspaper headline from moving a position)
```

**Leg B → Leg A synthesis (main-loop step after both return):** state explicitly the delta —
*"Leg B surfaced [X] that Leg A (portfolio-anchored) structurally could not have."* If Leg B
surfaces a name/theme that threatens a held thesis, that is a CONTRADICTION signal → fire a
Tier 2 verification subagent on it (it earns the cost more than a confirmation would).

**Leg B anti-decorative falsifier (first-week review 2026-07-03):** if 5 consecutive Leg B
scans surface ZERO new names AND ZERO new themes (only restatements of held-cohort
narratives), then either (a) the theme-sweep prompt is too narrow, or (b) the region genuinely
has low novel-signal density that window → tighten or merge. If Leg B routinely surfaces
candidates that later promote to theses or watchlist P1-P2, it is earning its cost — keep at
full Opus 4.8.

---

## Tier 2 trigger logic (fires deep verification only when criteria met)

For any item surfaced by any of the 4 scans that meets ANY of these criteria:
- Direct-named held-cohort event (HYNIX/MURATA/KIOXIA/SNDK/NBIS/SUMCO/MRVL specifically)
- >5% overnight move on any held position OR cohort peer (B45-regime-adjusted threshold)
- TC cluster N+1 candidate (would promote TC-1/TC-12/TC-13/PC-14)
- Cohort-decoupling diagnostic trigger (peer ±5% vs held name = idiosyncratic signal candidate)
- Forward-catalyst pre-registration event (earnings/CPI/inclusion grade firing window)
- Bloomberg/Reuters T1 quote from CEO/CFO of held name
- SEC F-1 / 8-K / 10-Q filing from held name

→ FIRE deep verification subagent (Opus 4.8, full Workflow #1 INGEST + cascade per Critical Rule #10)
→ Cost: ~80-120k tokens per deep fire
→ Estimated frequency: 1-3 deep fires per week given current signal density

**⚠️ GATE LIFTED (user decision 2026-07-06, first-week review):** Tier-2 deep-fires are AUTO-FIRE — do NOT pause to ask permission when a trigger criterion above is met (consistent with Critical Rule #16 never-ask posture). Binding guards remain: the per-wake budget envelope (Workflow #11) + the 2.5M-tokens/week falsifier ceiling + mandatory ledger entry per fire (review refinement R2) + the per-run convergence line (R1). Re-eval at the 2026-08-06 monthly review.

```

---

## Anti-decorative discipline (per Critical Rule #11 detectability framework)

If 5+ consecutive daily scans produce ZERO Tier 2 trigger fires → review at first-week
audit 2026-07-03 for either:
- Source-list expansion (catching more signal-density)
- Trigger criteria tightening (too high threshold)
- OR retire Workflow #10 if signal-density at autonomous-scan layer truly low

If signal-density at scan-layer is materially lower than user's Twitter-track (confirmed
via missed-items audit), retire Workflow #10 and reallocate budget to other harness
work.

---

## First-week review (todo item 2026-07-03)

After 5 trading days (Mon 2026-06-30 → Fri 2026-07-04), audit:
1. **What worked:** which sources surfaced highest signal/noise; which prompts caught
   patterns user's Twitter missed
2. **What didn't:** which sources noise-dominated; which prompts produced false-positive
   Tier 2 triggers
3. **Convergence rate:** % of scan items also surfaced by user same-day = independent-
   verification ratio (per 2026-06-26 design rationale)
4. **Cost vs benefit:** actual ~2M/week token cost vs material cascade events caught
5. **Prompt optimization:** refined templates per surfaced gaps + signal/noise learnings
6. **Source-list curation:** add/remove sources per actual signal quality
7. **Tier 2 trigger calibration:** adjust 5% threshold + held-cohort criteria per
   observed false-positive/negative rates

## REVISION 2026-06-26 PM — POST-CLOSE TIMING + EXPLICIT 24H WINDOW

**User directive 2026-06-26 PM:** post-close firing for all 3 scans + strict past-24h window.

### Revised firing times

| Scan | Old time | **NEW time** | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Korea + Japan | 01:30/01:45 CET (pre-open) | **09:00 CET** (post-close) | KRX+TSE closed 08:30 CET; full session captured |
| EU | 08:30 CET (pre-open) | **18:00 CET** (post-close) | Frankfurt closed 17:30 CET; full session captured |
| US | 15:00 CET (pre-open) | **22:00 CET** (live close) | NYSE closes 22:00 CET; full session captured |

### MANDATORY addition to every Workflow #10 scan prompt

```
TIME WINDOW (per Principle #42 candidate codified 2026-06-26 PM):
- STRICTLY PAST 24 HOURS from current trigger time
- Cite publication date for every item (must fall within 24h window)
- Items older than 24h = REJECT unless explicitly flagged as "historical context for
  current-window event"
- Forward-catalyst calendar may reference next 24-72h (forward-looking exempt)
- Multi-day pattern emergence = defer to weekly synthesis (Workflow #10-W Saturday)
```

### MANDATORY addition to source-list per scan

```
DIRECT PRIMARY-FILING FETCH (per first-week-review gap caught 2026-06-26):
- Pre-Korea: WebFetch dart.fss.or.kr for SK Hynix / Samsung Electronics 24h filings
- Pre-Japan: WebFetch tdnet-search.appspot.com for MURATA / KIOXIA / SUMCO / Shin-Etsu /
  Advantest 24h disclosures
- Pre-EU: SEC EDGAR overnight + DART overnight + TDnet overnight
- Pre-US: SEC EDGAR US intraday + cohort 8-K filings
```

### MANDATORY trigger-date vs system-date reconciliation

```
TRIGGER-DATE vs SYSTEM-DATE RECONCILIATION (per Principle #40 codified 2026-06-26):
- If trigger prompt references YYYY-MM-DD differently from system date, ACKNOWLEDGE
  discrepancy + USE SYSTEM DATE as authoritative
- Confirm in output: "Trigger label said [X]; system date is [Y]; treating as [Y]."
```

**These three additions** (time window + direct primary fetch + date reconciliation) **should be applied at next scan iteration** — fix the 3 prompt-optimization gaps caught in today's first fire.

## Leg B patch (2026-07-13, anomaly-register intake): every Leg B prompt now requests a SECOND output bucket — "ANOMALIES (2-3 max): uncommon/surprising items with NO thesis contact and NO obvious segment home; one line each with source+tier+why-uncommon." These route to `signals/anomaly-register.md`, not the cross-source log. The investable digest bucket is unchanged.

## NUMBERS-NOT-NARRATIVE patch (2026-07-16, user-articulated after the Nikkei arbitration inversion; applies to EVERY W10 scan prompt, both legs, effective next fire)

**User hypothesis (verbatim-adjacent):** *"we should not rely on media outlets' opinions. If it states wording that is opinionated ['led by X'], the agent should actually check the numbers themselves, or at least you have to verify the numbers whenever the agent comes back. That way we start steering more towards LLM-native reasoning instead of LLM-native aggregation of human opinions."*

**Origin failure (same day):** Leg A relayed a recycled Jun-16 "Advantest/Kioxia led gains +87" ranking as the Jul-16 close; main-loop arbitration kept it on tier self-label + narrative coherence even though the arithmetic against the on-file prior close (652.99-pt mismatch, computed) had ALREADY falsified it. The correct agent (Leg B) was rejected. User caught it from real closes — 3rd tape-catch of the week.

**Prompt-level additions (both legs, mandatory):**
1. **Every market-move claim ships as NUMBERS: prior close → close → computed delta → dated primary URL.** A leadership/causal attribution ("led by", "dragged by", "on X fears") WITHOUT the underlying per-name numbers is labeled `NARRATIVE-UNGRADED` — it may be reported, never used as tape.
2. **Date-pin mandatory:** every tape figure carries the article/print date extracted from URL or byline; figure without a pinnable date = `UNPINNED`, excluded from tape.
3. **Self-check arithmetic:** agent must verify its own close-vs-prior-close delta arithmetic in the output; a mismatch is reported as a mismatch, not smoothed.

**Main-loop arbitration rule (binding on me):**
- **An arithmetic contradiction KILLS a figure — it does not "queue" it.** If claimed delta ≠ computed delta off the on-file prior, the figure is dead until a date-pinned exchange print resolves it. (Today's failure: the mismatch was computed and then routed to a reconcile-queue while the dead figure kept steering the verdict.)
- Conflicting agents on same-day tape = a DATE question; the only resolver is a date-pinned primary. Tier self-labels and narrative coherence do not vote.
- Media CAUSAL wording is opinion-layer data (narrative field) — mechanism claims in verdicts must be either computed from numbers (what moved, how much, in what sequence) or explicitly tagged my-model hypothesis with P.

**Falsifier for this patch (re-eval at monthly audit):** if the next 10 wake scans produce ≥2 further tape inversions of this class despite the patch, the fix is prompt-cosmetic and the tape layer needs a deterministic data source (API layer) instead of agent search — escalate priority of the API-ingestion route.

## FACTS-FIRST WAKE ORDER (2026-07-16, user brain-dump on API go-live; extends the NUMBERS-NOT-NARRATIVE patch — binding from next fresh container)
W10 step-order inversion now that the tape is API-served: (0) TAPE FETCH FIRST — EODHD closes for held/watch names + indices (KRX live; TSE pending suffix fix), computed deltas + arithmetic cross-checks vs on-file priors, BEFORE any agent fires; (1) form my own move-hypotheses from the computed tape; (2) THEN Legs A/B run — their press reads now serve to (a) surface non-API facts (capacity/roadmap/design-win class) and (b) measure the narrative field against the computed reality; any agent tape claim that contradicts the API print is dead on arrival (no arbitration needed — the print wins). Budget note: EODHD 20 calls/day → tape fetch ≈ 6-8 calls (held names + KOSPI/Nikkei proxies), leaves headroom for event-driven pulls. Falsifier: co-located with methodology.md #43b/3e.
