LLM-Native-Reasoning pre-Stop hook for the AI Sector Research OS.

Triggers when assistant output contains pretraining-default reasoning
patterns in investment-analysis context, WITHOUT counterbalancing
LLM-native framing or explicit hedges.

Why this exists (codified 2026-06-01 per user calibration):

  User verbatim 2026-06-01: "before you spit out an output, you have
  to go back and check if you are ruling too much on your human based
  pretraining data and are actually applying LLM native reasoning and
  research principles. The human is linearly and slow and reunilateral.
  [LLM] is multilinearly. Can do multiple researches at the same time
  and can also look at not just US speaking web searches. You can also
  search if the company is Japanese, then you can do searches in
  Japanese."

  Origin: 2026-06-01 MLCC sub-supplier cohort synthesis (Noritake +
  Nippon Chemical + Hirano Tecseed) - I simultaneously committed
  multiple pretraining-default reasoning failures:
  - B39 (post-rally complacency anchoring)
  - Principle #35 (top-down structural theme not first)
  - Principle #36 (comfort signal misleading)
  - Cyclicality framing as risk without structural-vs-cyclical test
  - "Segment dilution" critique without multi-vector AI exposure test
  - Default to English-only sources for Japanese-listed companies

  User pointed out: codified principles don't internalize under pressure.
  Hooks are the deterministic enforcement mechanism. This hook catches
  the 4 most common pretraining-default patterns I fall into when
  doing investment analysis.

Triggers (any one of these patterns):

1. CYCLICALITY-WITHOUT-STRUCTURAL-TEST:
   "cyclicality" / "cyclical" / "cyclical play" appearing alongside
   risk/dilution/dampening language without explicit structural-vs-
   cyclical inflection check or right-side-of-Belka framing.

2. RALLY-HISTORY-AS-ENTRY-EVIDENCE:
   "up X% from low" / "+X% YTD" / "stock has rallied" / "X-bagged"
   appearing alongside entry-cautioning language (wait for pullback,
   watchlist, no add, Stage 3-4) without B39 5-test asymmetry framing
   or ATH-distance computation.

3. NON-US-LISTED-WITHOUT-NATIVE-LANGUAGE:
   Non-Western ticker pattern (\.T, \.KS, \.TW, \.HK, \.KQ) in
   investment-analysis context without explicit native-language source
   reference (Japanese search, Korean search, Chinese search, or
   ja/ko/zh language tokens in cited URL paths).

4. SEGMENT-DILUTION-WITHOUT-MULTI-VECTOR-TEST:
   "segment dilution" / "diluted by" / "multi-segment business" /
   "non-AI segments" appearing alongside thesis-impairment language
   without multi-vector AI exposure check or right-side-of-Belka
   surface-misclassification framing.

Exemptions (any one of these = pass):

- Meta-discussion: hook, principle #, .py, settings.json, B39, B40,
  Principle #35, Principle #36
- Explicit structural framing: "right-side-of-Belka", "structural
  inflection", "structural thesis", "B39 5-test"
- Explicit hedge tag: "(my model)", "(pretraining default)",
  "(English-only sources; verify in native language)",
  "(verified per native source)"
- Native-language source citation: Japanese/Korean/Chinese URL or
  explicit Japanese/Korean/Chinese search reference
- ATH-distance language: "below ATH", "X% from ATH", "all-time high"

Behavior: exit 2 with stderr feedback when triggered without exemption.
Required action: re-state with one of the corrections per failure mode.

Retirement triggers (codified 2026-06-01):
- Hook fires <3x/month over 3 consecutive months -> inert, retire
- False-positive rate (assistant legitimately couldn't apply correction)
  >40% -> refine exemption list
- Monthly audit (next 2026-06-24) reviews activation log

Scope: only enforces inside the research OS repo. Exit 0 outside.

Bias addressed: extends Principle #36 candidate (AI-native operating
frame) deterministic enforcement layer. Catches the multi-discipline
simultaneous failure mode (B40 candidate) where pretraining-pull
overrides codified principles under pressure.
