# To-Do — AI Sector Research OS

**Last updated:** 2026-07-06 (harness-audit pruning pass: 7 stale items archived/deleted, 4 live items re-framed post-exits, header was 34 days stale; prior: 2026-06-02 PM)
**Optimizes for:** rate at which signals become defensible, falsifiable, investable conviction earlier than consensus (per `meta/methodology.md` §Meta-First-Principle).

**SessionStart hook sort order:** P0 → P1 → P2 → P3, within priority: artifact-producing > process, within ties: tag count desc, then date asc.

**Tags** (from methodology.md): AF anti-fragility | BOT bottleneck-of-tomorrow | POS portfolio coherence | CAL calibration | INDP independence | INFRA harness infrastructure.

**Done item handling:** Items that produced a permanent artifact (thesis file, wiki entry, prediction, hook) get DELETED. Items that are process steps without an artifact get archived in `## Archive` so future Claude doesn't redo them.

**Parallel queue:** `meta/deep-dig-queue.md` tracks BOM-level component drills (Workflow 8 / DEEP-DIG). Not duplicated here — that queue runs on its own ranking criteria.

- [ ] **P2 / research / open** [INDP, AF, POS] — CONSUMER WORLD-REVIEW: SEALED-DIFF leg (build DONE 2026-07-11, `sector/consumer-adoption-worldview-2031.md` v2 adversarially amended; REMAINING: user sends his sealed picture -> diff artifact; then annual waypoint grading at year-end wakes)
  - Origin: user request + v2 refinement (verbatim-adjacent: "as if somebody asked you in 1999 how end consumers would interface with the Internet and what applications would be used at scale... a lot of people would not have foreseen Facebook or Google. That's what I want to hone in on. Doesn't have to be 2030 — any year"). SPEC v2 (supersedes v1 legs 1-2; keeps 3-5): **Leg 0 RETRODICTION-FIRST** — fit the forecasting method on TWO historical cycles (1999 internet, 2007 mobile) with the loser-gate (method must retrodict pets.com/WAP/push-tech failures too, else hindsight cosplay; pre-training contamination stated: the METHOD is the deliverable, not outcome memory). **Leg 1 PRIMITIVES-NOT-APPS** — what AI makes FREE + what NEW primitive has no pre-AI analog (persistent personal memory/context, delegated agency, synthetic relationships) — winners live on primitives, not better chatbots. **Leg 2 EMBRYO INVENTORY** — today's at-scale consumer residues ranked SixDegrees-2026 vs already-winner (usage curves, not press). **Leg 3 LATTICE + SURPRISE QUOTA** — each branch needs ≥1 mechanism-backed candidate as absurd-sounding today as life-uploading in 1999. Target year derived from the analogy's own timing structure (infra inflection + 8-10yrs ≈ 2030-2033). RETAINED from v1: waypoints wired to catalyst clock/calibration ledger; decision surface (venues/layers capturing the consumer surge per branch → book implications); sealed-diff protocol (user's picture only after mine is committed).
  - Scope: weekend-class, ~15-25 agent fires; SHARE EVIDENCE with funding-shock refresh + end-demand P1 (legs overlap). Fires when user sends the input block.

  - Origin: EU Leg B discovery → BIS Tier-2 verification (`signals/cross-source-log/2026-06-29-morning-feed-eu-2leg-bis-ai-credit-channel.md`). Harness models AI only from the physical supply side (HBM/NAND/wafers/MLCC/power) — NO node for the credit/funding transmission channel. If the next AI drawdown comes via credit (not chip oversupply), the framework is blind.
  - Scope: add an "AI-funding-shock" scenario to `sector/scenarios.md` (capex freezes via credit event → memory demand falls even with pristine memory balance sheets); recompute held-name anti-fragility under it (NBIS = HIGH exposure / leveraged buildout; memory names = self-funding-insulated but demand-exposed); install the **5-signal monitored set** as a standing watch: (1) neocloud HY spreads / GPU-backed-debt ratings + NBIS converts vs par; (2) neocloud raises failing/downsizing; (3) hyperscaler capex GUIDE cuts; (4) private-credit redemption/markdown; (5) GPU rental <~$1.50/hr.

### P2 — High priority new (added 2026-06-04 PM — bypass-route + architecture-of-tomorrow research)

- [ ] **P2 / research / 2026-06-05** [INDP, AF, POS, BOT] — Deep dive: BE Semiconductor Industries (BESI) — hybrid bonding equipment for 3D-stacked DRAM bypass route
  - Origin: 2026-06-04 PM BOTTLENECK-FORECAST surfaced BESI as bypass-route beneficiary when LPDDR5X bottleneck binds. Hybrid bonding is the TTQ-18-30mo qualification path for 3D DRAM stacking (HBM-style for consumer DRAM). Less crowded than KLA/Onto in inspection layer.
  - Investability: Euronext Amsterdam BESI ticker — Degiro accessible (confirmed)
  - Scope: full thesis build — hybrid bonding moat vs ASMPT competitor; HBM4 + HBM5 production wins; consumer DRAM 3D-stacking opportunity timing; analyst consensus; post-2026 guidance accelerators; FY27 framework
  - Key bypass-route question: when LPDDR5X bottleneck forces 3D-stacking workaround at memory mfg level, does BESI capture the equipment spend?
  - Linked: `signals/cross-source-log/2026-06-04-next-bottleneck-lpddr5x-mobile-dram-forecast.md` bypass-route section; `wiki/advanced-packaging-primer.md`

- [ ] **P2 / research / 2026-06-30** [INDP, AF, POS] — NVDA entry-trigger watch (post Apple-Blackwell + Rubin BOM optimization)
  - Origin: 2026-06-04 PM Apple-Blackwell cascade surfaced NVDA as REINFORCED thesis (marquee customer Apple confirms inference dominance). Currently 0% held per holdings.md. Need entry framework given L21 sector regime + €200K cash deployment cadence.
  - Scope: define entry triggers + sizing (recommended 4-6% if entered, per portfolio target band); monitor for L21 regime break OR macro pullback >10% from current
  - Falsifiers: NVDA Q2 FY27 (August) negative reaction despite BEAT + macro-neutral environment = L21 regime more severe; do not enter
  - Linked: `companies/NVDA/thesis.md` (updated 2026-06-04 PM with Apple-Blackwell signal); `portfolio/constraints.md` (FIRE math + cash deployment); `predictions/lessons.md` L21

  - Origin: 2026-06-04 PM Camtek DEEP-DIG v2.1 surfaced NVMI as adjacent Israeli metrology pure-play; $880M FY26 revenue, 57.6% gross margin, $1.6B war chest per Koalagains T3 (already cited in `companies/CAMT/thesis.md`)
  - Scope: full thesis build — competitive positioning vs CAMT (dimensional metrology vs packaging inspection), GAA + advanced DRAM Nova Metrion platform, FY26 financials, analyst consensus, post-guidance accelerators, Israeli geo tail risk overlap (NOT a hedge)
  - Key question: is NVMI a BETTER architecture-of-tomorrow bet than CAMT?
  - Linked: `companies/CAMT/thesis.md` competitive section; `predictions/lessons.md` L22

- [ ] **P2 / research / 2026-06-05** [INDP, AF, POS] — Deep dive: Onto Innovation (ONTO) — architecture-of-tomorrow CAMT competitor
  - Origin: 2026-06-04 PM user articulation — "where's the best chance to win the architecture of tomorrow. Right? Today's winner might lose tomorrow because they're not gonna qualify for the next cycle." Applied to CAMT vs ONTO: P(ONTO wins HBM5)=40% vs P(CAMT extends)=35% (my model)
  - Scope: full thesis build — Dragonfly G5 + 3Di moat vs Hawk; HBM5 + 1000-layer NAND positioning; FY26 raised guide >$1.3B; 30%+ OP margin EOY 2026 target; investability NYSE
  - Key question: should portfolio enter ONTO instead of CAMT as architecture-of-tomorrow play?
  - Linked: `companies/CAMT/thesis.md` competitive section; Onto IR T1

### P1 — High priority (next session — added 2026-05-28 end of session)

- [ ] **P2 / research / 2026-08-15** [INDP, AF, POS] — Structural Winners Cohort dissection — name-by-name deep-dive
  - Origin: 2026-06-08 PM user-articulated 4-way structural winner + 12-architecture resilience synthesis; user directive: "save that entire list, and we can talk about this list tomorrow... maybe dissect them a little bit more"
  - Scope: Read `research/meta/structural-winners-cohort.md` — go through the 27 ranked names tier-by-tier. Priority dissection order: TIER 1 NEW (Shin-Etsu Chemical 4063.T + Nidec 6594.T), then TIER 2 cluster (TEL + AMAT + LRCX + KLA + ASML + APH + Hirose + TXN + ADI), then TIER 3 single-dependency names. Per Principle #36 multilingual parallel for Japan TSE names (Japanese press for Shin-Etsu + Nidec + TEL + Hirose + Daikin + Lasertec + HOYA + Harmonic Drive + Nabtesco).
  - Linked: `meta/structural-winners-cohort.md` (THE list); `signals/cross-source-log/2026-06-08-*` (all today's cascades supporting the synthesis)
  - Detectability: dissection produces (a) investability confirmation per name, (b) updated tier ranking if new data emerges, (c) 1-2 thesis-promotion candidates ready for deep-dive

- [x] **P1 / research / 2026-06-25** [INDP, AF, POS, BOT] — Monthly recurring: Supply chain graph reconstruction (H1 capability application)
  - Origin: 2026-06-06 PM user conversation re: Opus 4.8 capability mapping to investing (analog: Hornby+Claude Zcash audit). H1 of 5 candidate applications scored highest leverage. Codifies as monthly subagent-driven workflow.
  - Scope: subagent fans out across the AI hardware capex chain (compute → memory → substrate → CCL → power → cooling → optics → consumer-AI add-on). Reads 10-K/6-K/earnings transcripts + Japanese/Korean/Chinese trade press in parallel per Critical Rule #6 + Principle #36. Reconstructs Tier-3/Tier-4 supplier graph with revenue concentration + named customers. Surfaces 5-10 non-consensus names per cycle that meet (a) investability filter (no KRX-only, no Taiwan-only without ADR), (b) revenue concentration to AI cohort >25%, (c) market cap <$50B (under-followed).
  - Output: cross-source-log artifact + candidates added to watchlist + flag for next deep-dig queue.
  - Linked: `watchlist/candidates.md` (Consumer hardware swap section added 2026-06-06 PM as N=1 manual instance of this workflow), `signals/cross-source-log/2026-06-06-mag7-capex-burn-vs-net-cash-correction.md` (capex sizing inputs), Principle #29 (segment-classify), Critical Rule #6 (multilingual parallel).
  - Detectability: POSITIVE = each cycle surfaces ≥3 names not already in watchlist; NEGATIVE = 2 consecutive cycles produce only known names → retire or refine.
  - Recurring cadence: monthly. Next cycle: 2026-07-25.

- [x] **P1 / research / 2026-06-27** [INDP, AF, POS, CAL] — Monthly recurring: Adversarial bear-case stress-test on held cohort (H2 capability application)
  - Origin: 2026-06-06 PM user conversation re: Opus 4.8 capability mapping. H2 of 5 candidate applications — analog to Hornby's exploit construction VERIFYING the Zcash flaw. Per-held-name "kill the thesis" exercise.
  - Scope: for each of 10 held positions (per `portfolio/holdings.md`), subagent constructs the STRONGEST possible bear thesis — looks for the constraint-system flaw in current bull thesis. Stress-tests against: (a) named falsifier conditions (do any currently apply?), (b) hidden assumptions in segment-trajectory model, (c) competitive displacement risk overlooked, (d) macro regime modifier compounding, (e) valuation expansion vs fundamentals gap. Output: per-name bear-case stress-test note appended to `companies/{TICKER}/thesis.md` with explicit "what specifically would need to happen to invalidate" — different from existing Falsifiers section because it's adversarial-construction not threshold-listing.
  - Output: per-held-name bear-case section added; if bear case scores ≥6/10 strength, flag for SCENARIO-UPDATE or sizing reconsideration with explicit Position implication (Critical Rule #11).
  - Linked: all 10 thesis files in `companies/`, `predictions/lessons.md` L21-L23, `meta/biases-watchlist.md` B42-B43, Critical Rule #8 (no reactive trim but DO act on falsified thesis).
  - Detectability: POSITIVE = each cycle either surfaces new structural risk OR reinforces conviction with documented stress-test (varied outcomes); NEGATIVE = 3 consecutive cycles produce identical "no material concern" → exercise became decorative.
  - Recurring cadence: monthly. Next cycle: 2026-07-27.

- [x] **2026-06-03 — RESOLVED NOT INVESTABLE** Co-Tech Development (8358.TW) investability check
  - Resolution: Per user direct check 2026-06-03 — Taiwan TWSE 8358 NOT supported by Degiro OR N26 brokerages. Co-Tech moved to REFERENCE ARTIFACT only (similar to KRX names per `CLAUDE.md` investability filter). Thesis analysis remains valid for harness (HVLP4 only qualified 2nd source per Goldman; projected 5%→53% share 2025-2028) but cannot be acted on. Mitsui (5706.T Japan TSE) + Furukawa (5801.T Japan TSE) remain the investable bypass-route names per `companies/MITSUI/thesis.md`.

  - Origin: Mitsui Mining 4-subagent deep-dive 2026-06-02 surfaced Co-Tech as ONLY qualified HVLP4 2nd source globally per Goldman; HVLP3+ share projected 5%(2025)→53%(2028); gross profit mix 8%→77%; capacity 200→400 t/mo HVLP3/4 by YE2026. Goldman initiated Buy NT$900.
  - Scope: (a) Confirm Taiwan TWSE 8358 investability on user's Degiro + N26 brokerages; (b) if investable, run full thesis with Workflow 8 DEEP-DIG quality bar (≥2 indep sources for capacity, ≥1 supply response, ≥3 tickers cross-stack, ≥1 LOSER, specific falsifier); (c) compare against Mitsui Stage 3-4 entry penalty — Co-Tech at Stage 1-2 likely better Kelly bet

  - Origin: 2026-07-01 BE+ALAB deep-dives + a 2-agent pipeline-vs-turbine verify (`signals/cross-source-log/2026-07-01-gas-pipeline-vs-turbine-time-to-power-2agent.md`). **CORRECTION: the original "~24-inch pipeline live ~2026-08-15" spec was UNVERIFIED — struck.** The real marquee gas-gated build is Oracle/BorderPlex "Project Jupiter" (NM, 2.45GW Bloom fuel cells) fed by the ~16-18mi "Green Chile" lateral off an EXISTING El Paso Natural Gas trunk. The lateral itself is fast (14-day BLM emergency review); the gate is permitting/legal.
  - Scope: (a) Track Project Jupiter's gas-connection gating items — Transwestern's Jan-2026 FERC application, the NM State Land Office denial on state trust land, the environmental protest; (b) if these BLOCK or materially delay the gas connection OR any marquee DC customer cites gas-supply as the binding constraint → "weeks not years" weakened → re-examine BE bull + hold/trim; (c) if the gas connection clears → speed-edge CONFIRMED → clears the staged remainder of the BE entry
  - Falsifier (revised, per BE thesis falsifier #1 + #5): gas connection blocked/materially delayed by the FERC/State-Land/protest items = thesis weakened; OR heavy-duty turbine lead times compress <~2.5yr before 2028 / PJM queue reform <2yr at scale = Bloom's time-to-power window closes structurally
  - REINFORCING context (do not lose): the verified turbine backlog (~4-6+yr time-to-power; GEV ~100GW backlog sold out into 2029-30) VALIDATES the core BE bull — the turbine queue is what creates Bloom's ~90-day window. The gas-supply risk is a permitting/legal + upstream-compression conditional, NOT a dated pipeline binary.
  - Also-watch: BE Q2 2026 print (~Jul-30) — GM trajectory (~30% Q1 base) + backlog firm-vs-framework split; ALAB Q2 FY2026 (~Aug-11) — Scorpio ramp toward #1-product-line guide

  - **30-day experiment framing**: Track structural-output-hook fire rate week-by-week to distinguish:
    - **H1 (P~70% my model)**: pretraining gravity dominates → fires plateau or stay flat → retire both hooks
    - **H2 (P~20% my model)**: priming materially shifts default mode → fires DECREASE over 4 weeks → keep
    - **H3 (P~10% my model)**: architecture wrong; behavioral discipline higher leverage → fires INCREASE or stay flat AND user reports no qualitative shift → conclude H3, retire hooks
  - Week-1 check 2026-06-08: count structural-output-hook fires in past 7 days, log to `meta/recurring-audit-log.md`. Initial baseline expected ~30%+ fire rate; target trajectory toward <10% by end of 4 weeks.

  - **Reason dropped (user-directed 2026-06-01)**: IP licensing business cannot achieve same physical-scarcity moat as physical chokepoints (Murata MLCC, Sandisk NAND, Micron HBM, Hirano tape-casters). Moat type is contractual/legal/switching-cost, not capacity-constrained. Different moat type → outside scope of alt-data probabilistic prediction framework (which is built for physical chokepoint identification). User unverified hypothesis: "IP licensing from unit economics, they can never achieve that type of scarcity that a Sandisk or a Micron or a Murata can." Hypothesis acknowledged as unverified but structurally consistent with Right-Side-of-Belka physical-scarcity principle. Revisit if hypothesis later falsified.

  - **Refinement 2026-05-31 (user-directed)**: both already at ATH but hardware order book gives quarter-to-quarter visibility ONLY ("limited visibility" per Teradyne 10-Q); deep-dive must address whether AI test cycle extends into 2027 OR peaks 2026; Advantest 44.2% op margin is near structural ceiling = MARGIN RUNWAY SHRINKING question is central

  - **PREP CHECKLIST COMPLETE 2026-06-19** at `meta/monthly-audit-prep-2026-06-24.md` — 10 batched candidates + Sections 2-10 (Critical Rule #11 detectability / AUTO-EXECUTE STRENGTHENING / source-reliability / bottleneck-forecast / portfolio-coherence / cross-domain-pattern-register / session-prime / INDEX-tags refresh / Critical Rule #16 detectability) + autonomous-completion authorization status pre-loaded + pre-batched grep commands ready
  - **CONSOLIDATION NOTE 2026-05-29**: Previously 3 separate June 24 items (codification audit + claim-verification audit + Principle #34/B38 monitoring). User-directed merge into single audit per "doesn't make sense to have it three times."
  - **PART A — Codification audit** (expanded scope per 2026-05-28): each gets the 3-question test:
    - Principles: #29 (segmented triangulation), #30 (comp-set verification), #31 (narrative-stage modifier), #32 (pre-action checkpoints), #33 (top-down capability decomposition + 2026-05-28 competition-intensity refinement), candidate #34 (Supplier-Side Cross-Layer Moat Decomposition — check for N=2+ validation)
    - Biases: B31 (cross-segment aggregation), B32 (comp-set anchoring at valuation), B33 (narrative-stage-blind sizing), B34 (action without verification or premortem), B35 (within-category aggregation), B36 (visible-user-adoption anchoring when embedded), candidate B38 (demand-side decomposition blind-spot — check for N=2+ validation; promote OR retain candidate OR retire)
    - L14 (CODIFIED 2026-06-02): verify 2+ applications post-codification; confirm Stage 3-4 CATEGORY override is correctly applied in new PRO predictions
    - L15 (NEW 2026-06-02): verify corporate-event check discipline has been applied to any EPS prediction in first 30 days; confirm checklist is not wasted overhead
    - L16 (CANDIDATE 2026-06-02): check if N=2 accumulation-vs-conversion case has surfaced; promote or retain candidate
    - **3 questions per codification**: (1) APPLIED since codification? (check `principle-applications-log.md` + grep recent commits); (2) if applied → REAL CATCH / FALSE POSITIVE / WASTED OVERHEAD; (3) if NOT applied in 30 days → INERT → retire OR promote to hook
    - **Metrics**: Real-catch rate ≥40%; false-positive <30%; wasted-overhead <30%; net-positive (REAL_CATCHES > WASTED_OVERHEADS over 30 days)
  - **PART B — Claim-verification audit** (per principle #23, codified 2026-05-24 after TrendForce HBF debacle):
    - Sample 15 recent claims from thesis files + signals + wiki entries committed 2026-05-24 to 2026-06-24
    - For each, verify: (a) first-order assertion stripped of interpretation, (b) ≥1 orthogonal corroboration at ingest, (c) single-source claims correctly went to `cross-source-log.md` not thesis files
    - Re-audit 6 sources in legacy reliability queue (MLQ.ai, Sacra, Fortune, Photoncap, TweakTown, The Razor's Edge) using claim-verification framing (sample 3 claims/source; check orthogonal corroboration at citation)
    - Flag failures in `sector/where-we-are.md` harness observations log
  - **PART C — Critical Rule #11 detectability check** (added 2026-05-28):
    - Grep `Position implication:` across thesis files committed 30 days prior
    - Verify VARIED implications (mix of ENTER / HOLD / TRIM / EXIT / NO ACTION); if 5+ identical "HOLD — no size change" → rule decorative; retire or refine
  - **Failure mode the audit protects against**: rapid codification cadence producing ossified text that's never actually applied = the most likely OS-degradation pathway given the recent codification velocity (Principles #29 → #34 + B31 → B38 + L14-L16 in <45 days)
  - **Where to document outcome**: `research/meta/principle-applications-log.md` "Monthly audit log" section
  - **Automation verification** (per user request 2026-05-29): 2 mechanisms confirm this will surface on 2026-06-24:
    1. `~/.claude/session-start-hook.py` is date-aware — surfaces with OVERDUE / DUE TODAY / DUE SOON markers at top of session briefing if user starts a session that day or after
    2. `.github/workflows/recurring-audit-reminder.yml` runs weekly Monday 9am UTC; creates a GitHub issue when DUE_SOON / DUE_TODAY / OVERDUE fires
  - **Linked**: `meta/methodology.md` (Principles #29-#34), `meta/biases-watchlist.md` (B31-B38), `meta/principle-applications-log.md`, `meta/recurring-audit-log.md`, recent commit log

- [ ] **P2 / research / 2026-06-05** [INDP] — Back-fill China sovereignty cluster TRACE event (verification catch 2026-05-28)
  - Origin: 2026-05-28 verification step caught that `signals/events/2026-05-26-china-ai-sovereignty-cluster.md` does NOT exist despite my session-memory claim. The cluster's prior signals (Huawei LogicFolding May 25 + China talent restrictions May 26 + DeepSeek V4 State AI Fund May 16) exist only as scattered cross-references across ARM thesis + Google I/O event + 13F analysis. Today's "China 9 chips certified" (May 28) signal would be 3rd-4th data point if cluster were properly documented.
  - Scope: (a) Read prior signals from ARM thesis cross-refs, Google I/O event file, 13F analysis to extract verified facts; (b) cross-verify Huawei LogicFolding announcement details + China talent restriction scope via independent T1/T2 sources; (c) consolidate into proper TRACE event file at `signals/events/2026-05-26-china-ai-sovereignty-cluster.md`; (d) IF cluster has 3+ verified same-segment data points within 90 days, promote to `signals/triangulation.md` as 2nd segmented-triangulation entry (advanced-packaging EMIB-T was 1st).
  - **Discipline catch this represents**: per principle #32 + the user's discipline LOOP (spot/fix/monitor), this is a "fix" step that was incomplete on 2026-05-27 — I referenced a TRACE event without committing it. The verification step today caught the gap.
  - Linked: `companies/ARM/thesis.md` (existing cross-refs), `signals/events/2026-05-20-google-io-2026.md`, `meta/2026-05-26-positional-strength-duration.md`, `signals/cross-source-log.md` (today's China 9 chips entry)


### P3 — Foundational wiki entries (planned, not yet built)

**Depth standard:** All wiki entries below must meet `meta/methodology.md` core principle #12 (default BELOW revenue mix). Revenue-mix summaries are insufficient — each wiki must include BOM-level unit counts, current-gen → next-gen deltas where applicable, and supplier capacity-response data. See B15 in `biases-watchlist.md`.

- [ ] **P3 / wiki / 2026-05-21** [INFRA] — Hyperscaler capex primer
  - Scope: How to read MSFT/GOOG/META/AMZN/ORCL capex disclosures; segment definitions; ROIC implications. **BOM-depth requirement:** include dollars-per-GW deployed at current vs next-gen rack densities, not just headline capex numbers.


- [ ] **P3 / wiki / 2026-05-21** [INFRA] — Geopolitical AI primer
  - Scope: US-China tech war, export controls, allowed/restricted lists, Taiwan dependence. **BOM-depth requirement:** wafer-volume by node × geography; specific HSCD-controlled items; substitution paths.

- [ ] **P2 / harness / 2026-07-24** [INFRA, recurring] — PRUNING DISCIPLINE monthly pass (LLM-native context-hygiene, codified 2026-06-27 audit item #3)
  - **ADDED 2026-07-07 (Principle #43 standing question — wired here so the audit actually asks it):** run the AFFORDANCE REVIEW per `methodology.md` #43b protocol — (1) inventory-vs-usage diff from ledgers/logs (mechanical); (2) anthropomorphic-default sweep (human-time estimates, single-threaded plans, essay-instead-of-computation); (3) each candidate → pre-registered executable test, NOT self-report. Also: renumber the #42 collision (retrieval-staleness vs time-window) per tags.md flag.
  - Origin: 2026-06-27 LLM-native audit — harness is engineered to ACCRETE (every cascade appends) but my attention budget per context degrades with length ("lost in the middle"); a bloated harness dilutes retrieval MORE for an LLM than it slows a human. There is an accrete cadence but no matching PRUNE cadence.
  - Scope (monthly, 24th, alongside consolidated audit): identify what can be archived/compressed without losing load-bearing state — oversized thesis files (rounds 1-N → compress resolved rounds to a 1-line ledger + link), tier-cascade-log + subagent-cost-yield-ledger rotation (archive >30-day entries to a dated archive file, keep audit-summary head), stale cross-source-log consolidation, session-prime cap enforcement (≤500 lines). Treat pruning with the SAME seriousness as the audits — bloat is a silent cognition tax.
  - Metric: total harness char-count growth rate; per-file size flags (thesis.md >X KB → compress-resolved-rounds candidate); was anything load-bearing lost? (must be NO)
  - Linked: `meta/methodology.md`, `meta/session-prime.md` cap rules, `companies/*/thesis.md`, `meta/tier-cascade-log.md`, `meta/subagent-cost-yield-ledger.md`

- [ ] **P1 / harness / 2026-07-27** [INFRA, CAL] — Critical Rules #17 (ensembling) + #18 (dissent mandate) 30-day detectability re-eval
  - Origin: 2026-06-27 LLM-native audit codification (CLAUDE.md Rules #17/#18)
  - Scope #17: grep for ensembled high-stakes calls; did spread vary meaningfully (some 5/5, some 3/5)? did 3/5-flagged calls correlate with later-graded misses? POSITIVE = spread predicted uncertainty; NEGATIVE = always 5/5 (decorative) OR spread never correlates → retire
  - Scope #18: did thesis/sizing outputs reliably contain a falsifying-case section AND did it occasionally flip/temper a conclusion? POSITIVE = load-bearing; NEGATIVE = rote "bear case dismissed" boilerplate never changing a conclusion → refine or build falsifier-section Stop hook
  - Linked: `CLAUDE.md` Critical Rules #17/#18; `predictions/inference-log.md`; `meta/subagent-cost-yield-ledger.md`

## Archive (completed process items without permanent artifact)

### 2026-07-06 harness-audit pruning pass (7 items archived, 1 deleted)

*(MRVL thesis-build item DELETED per the artifact rule — `companies/MRVL/thesis.md` exists, full 06-12 refresh; MRVL exited 06-27.)*

- [x] **P2 / verification / 2026-05-30** [AF, POS] — DISCO 6146.T ENTRY decision pending capital allocation post-Monday execution
  - **ARCHIVED 2026-07-06:** premise dead: 'post-Monday-2026-06-01 execution capital check' predates two full book resets; deployment envelope-locked since 07-05. DISCO thesis (5/5 anti-fragility) remains on file for future entry consideration.

- [x] **P2 / research / 2026-06-06** [INDP, POS, AF] — Computex 2026 post-event INGEST brief (Computex June 2-5; NVIDIA GTC Taipei keynote June 1)
  - **ARCHIVED 2026-07-06:** event was June 2-5; ingest never delivered and is now a month stale; primary cascade target (ARM AGI CPU thesis) exited 06-14. Any Computex-material facts have since arrived through normal feeds.

- [x] **P2 / verification / 2026-08-15** [CAL, AF, POS] — ARM Q2/Q3 FY27 earnings verification — AGI CPU revenue contribution + blended margin trajectory + FTC probe direction
  - **ARCHIVED 2026-07-06:** scope was a SIZE-UP/HOLD decision on a held ARM position — ARM exited 2026-06-14; item is moot. Re-open only if ARM re-entry is ever considered (thesis retained as watchlist-reference).

- [x] **P2 / verification / 2026-06-15** [INDP, AF] — Schwab June 2026 AI agent launch — triangulation 3rd-data-point candidate
  - **ARCHIVED 2026-07-06:** 21d overdue; cascade targets (DDOG observability / SNDK compliance-NAND validation) both exited. Agentic-brokerage 3rd-datapoint can resurface organically via Leg B; no standing item needed.

- [x] **P2 / verification / 2026-06-24** [INDP, AF, POS] — TC-9 candidate promotion decision (agentic-observability mandate)
  - **ARCHIVED 2026-07-06:** RESOLVED NO-PROMOTE 2026-07-06 (documented in triangulation.md index note): promotion review lapsed at the 06-24 audit, then DDOG/NOW — the cluster's beneficiaries — were sold 06-22. TC-9 number stays reserved.

- [x] **P2 / research / 2026-06-20** [INDP, POS] — Document why DDOG + NOW were trimmed -33%/-35% in 2026-06-12 rotation
  - **ARCHIVED 2026-07-06:** superseded: the -33%/-35% trims became FULL EXITS 2026-06-22 (user self-flagged Critical Rule #8 violation); both theses carry EXIT banners + 3-layer GRADEs — the documentation this item wanted exists in stronger form.

- [x] **P3 / verification / 2026-06-25** [INDP] — Contrail Compute AIX RISC-V AI execution platform T1 verification
  - **ARCHIVED 2026-07-06:** premise stale: framed as 'ARM-alternative threat watch (ARM held 3.2%)' — ARM exited 06-14; single-source vendor PR never corroborated in 3+ weeks of feeds.


(Items that DID produce a permanent artifact are deleted — the artifact replaces the to-do. The artifact location is noted in case future Claude needs to find it.)

- [x] **2026-06-02** [CAL, INDP] — HPE Q2 FY26 GRADE + L14 N=2 validation — COMPLETED per artifact production
  - Reason: Grade completed; L14 CODIFIED at N=2 (Stage 3-4 CATEGORY EVENT override validated by HPE +29-36% T+24h); L15 NEW (corporate event INPUT checklist); L16 CANDIDATE (accumulation vs conversion cohort sub-mechanism). Supply-Chain-Cohort Calibration framework: REFINE verdict (direction correct; magnitude under-predicted due to H3C INPUT gap + DELL sub-mechanism mismatch). Pending grade item removed from Pending table in grading-log.md.
  - Artifacts: `predictions/2026-06-01-HPE-Q2FY26-GRADE.md` (GRADED), `predictions/lessons.md` (L14 codified + L15 + L16 added), `predictions/grading-log.md` (HPE moved to Graded), `meta/todo.md` (this archive entry)

- [x] **2026-05-29** [INDP, AF] — ESTC contrarian-asymmetric-opportunity check — CLOSED per artifact production
  - Reason: substantial analysis produced + committed to `companies/ESTC/thesis.md` (Q4 FY26 actuals + temporal anchoring correction on "feature not a business" Aug 2025 quote + L14 framework NEAR-TERM-MISS/LONG-TERM-STRONG-GUIDE classification + position implication CONSIDER ENTER 2-3% pending Q4 FY26 transcript verification). Remaining transcript-pull step is conditional on user decision to act on entry; no longer requires a P1 task slot.
  - Artifact retained: `companies/ESTC/thesis.md` (updated 2026-05-29)

- [x] **2026-05-29** [INDP, AF] — 4092 (Nippon Chemical Industrial) entry-trigger watch — ARCHIVED per investability constraint
  - Reason: Degiro + N26 both lack access to NCI 4092 (user confirmed 2026-05-29). Same pattern as LGI archive 2026-05-28 (KRX inaccessibility). Small/mid-cap Japanese specialty ticker outside platform universe.
  - Artifact retained: `meta/2026-05-26-ath-refresh-and-4092-prediction.md` as reference for BaTiO3 supply chain analysis (status banner added). Alternative investable BaTiO3 candidates: Sakai 4078 + TDK 6762 + Shoei 4953 (Shoei confirmed inaccessible; Sakai/TDK access verification pending).

- [x] **2026-05-29** [INDP, AF, BOT] — Continuous-agent infrastructure category thesis build candidate — CLOSED per artifact production
  - Reason: Substantial sector-level analysis lives in `signals/events/2026-05-28-anthropic-mythos-continuous-agent-infrastructure.md` (continuous-agent infrastructure cascade + fluid-software-mesh thesis + named plays at each layer + falsifiers). 2026-05-29 AWS+Cloudflare infrastructure-rebuild signal (per `signals/cross-source-log/2026-05-29-ai-intelligence-brief-morning.md`) validated the category at hyperscaler-primary level. Decision: TRACE event file serves the analytical purpose; standalone dedicated category-thesis file deferred as redundant.
  - Artifact retained: `signals/events/2026-05-28-anthropic-mythos-continuous-agent-infrastructure.md` + cross-source-log validation

- [x] **2026-05-28** [INDP, AF] — LG Innotek (KRX: 011070) deeper dig — ARCHIVED NOT COMPLETED
  - Reason: User confirmed 2026-05-28 that LGI is not directly investable on either of the platforms they use (KRX direct access not supported; no sponsored ADR available — only unsponsored pink-sheet listings most platforms block). Investability-first discipline: no point completing deeper research on uninvestable name.
  - Artifact retained: `companies/LGINNOTEK/thesis.md` remains as reference for substrate-supplier cross-comparisons (Ibiden / SEMCO / Murata). Status banner added to thesis file.
  - Same investability constraint applies to SEMCO (009150.KS) — flagged in `companies/SEMCO/thesis.md` investability section. SEMCO retained as N=1 origin case for candidate Principle #34 / B38 + as reference artifact for substrate-supplier comparisons.
  - Substrate-supplier exposure now anchored on: Ibiden (4062.T, Japan — accessible via Japan TSE direct or IBDSF/IBDSY pink-sheet ADR depending on platform) + Murata (held, 12.4-16.77%).

- [x] **2026-05-20** [INFRA] — Build anti-fabrication Stop hook

- [x] **2026-05-21** [INFRA, BOT, INDP] — Build DEEP-DIG workflow (default below revenue mix)
  - Origin: User feedback 2026-05-21 after MLCC SemiAnalysis-style image — "stop focusing on a high level that most analysts do, which is look at the revenue mix. Like, that's quite superficial."
  - Artifacts: `research/CLAUDE.md` §Workflow 8 (DEEP-DIG); `research/meta/biases-watchlist.md` B15 (revenue-mix-anchoring); `research/meta/methodology.md` core principle #12 (default below revenue mix); `research/meta/deep-dig-queue.md` (NEW — 10-item ranked queue of BOM-level component drills)

- [x] **2026-05-21** [INFRA, BOT] — Run first DEEP-DIG worked example: MLCCs / GB200 → Rubin
  - Origin: First execution of Workflow 8; seeded by user-shared image with 6,500 → ~12,000 MLCCs per board.
  - Artifact: `research/companies/MURATA/thesis.md` §BOM-level deep-dig — full cross-stack cascade table, supplier capacity-response triangulation (Murata + Samsung EM + price hikes), named bypass-route losers (consumer OEMs Apple/Samsung Mobile/Xiaomi; lower-end MLCC vendors Yageo/Walsin), cross-cascade to VICR via shared Rubin TDP-doubling mechanism, specific falsifiers
  - Queue status: item #1 marked complete in `meta/deep-dig-queue.md`; items #2-#10 remain

- [x] **2026-05-21** [INDP, BOT] — Dylan Patel "2-3x more memory pricing" source-citation + thesis deep dive + Aschenbrenner comparison
  - Origin: User-reported podcast claim 2026-05-20 (was P1 open item); user requested 2026-05-21 deep dive + Aschenbrenner comparison
  - Artifact: `research/meta/patel-vs-aschenbrenner-thesis-comparison.md` — full thesis comparison + verified Patel claim sourcing (DRAM "double or triple" per [24/7 Wall St 2026-04-23](https://247wallst.com/personal-finance/2026/04/23/dram-will-double-or-triple-from-here-as-ai-demand-outpaces-supply-chain-capacity/))
  - Side-effect: `research/meta/source-reliability.md` updated with verified Patel track record including resolved memory-pricing claim and 4 additional triangulated claims

- [x] **2026-05-21** [INFRA, BOT, INDP] — Build cascade-enforcement Stop hook (B16 → hook)
  - Origin: User insight 2026-05-21 — "instructions are choices; hooks are enforced." After B16 (synthesis-without-cascade) was caught, the cascade discipline needed deterministic enforcement.
  - Artifact: `~/.claude/cascade-enforcement-hook.py` + `~/.claude/settings.json` registration + `research/meta/hooks/` repo mirror + `research/meta/hooks/README.md`
  - Testing: 5 test cases passed (baseline, deliberate violation, restore, JSON stdin, recursion guard)

- [x] **2026-05-21** [INFRA, BOT] — Memory cycle wiki primer with BOM-level depth
  - Origin: P3 wiki entry per `meta/methodology.md` core principle #12 (default below revenue mix)
  - Artifact: `research/wiki/memory-cycle-primer.md` — DRAM/HBM/NAND cycle dynamics + per-stack ASP/GB economics + crowding-out math + supplier capacity timeline through 2028
  - Cascade: HYNIX, SNDK, MURATA thesis files updated with cross-references per CLAUDE.md Rule #10 (cascade-enforcement hook verified exit 0)
  - Side-effect: cascade-enforcement hook updated to include `research/wiki/*-primer.md` + `research/wiki/*-scaling.md` patterns

- [x] **2026-05-21** [POS, AF, BOT] — All P3 research thesis files built (14 names across 3 groups)
  - **Power equipment (5):** `companies/{GEV, ETN, HUBB, POWL, VRT}/thesis.md` — Tier 2+3 power names from `wiki/power-for-ai-primer.md`
  - **Storage/data candidates (5):** `companies/{PSTG, NTAP, ESTC, CFLT, TEAM}/thesis.md` — cascade-walk additions. CFLT flagged as IBM merger-arb only ($31/share takeout pending mid-2026)
  - **Smaller Aschenbrenner-surfaced (4):** `companies/{BITF, HIVE, BTDR, SHAZ}/thesis.md` — Bitfarms, HIVE Digital, Bitdeer, SharonAI from Q1 2026 13F. BTDR highest conviction (Tydal 180 MW for Rubin co-lo); SHAZ highest asymmetry (newly public Feb 2026)

- [x] **2026-05-21** [INFRA, INDP] — Anti-fabrication hook calibration (repo-grounding check)
  - Origin: User insight 2026-05-21 — chat summaries of properly-cited file content shouldn't burn turns on hook violations. Files = source of truth.
  - Artifact: `~/.claude/anti-fabrication-hook.py` updated + `research/meta/hooks/anti-fabrication-hook.py` mirror + CLAUDE.md Critical Rule #7 expanded + biases-watchlist.md B11.a calibration documented
  - Test cases: 5 passing (grounded numbers pass silently; fabrications still blocked)

- [x] **2026-05-21** [INDP, CAL] — Source-reliability framework expansion + first-pass audit (10 sources)
  - Origin: User calibration 2026-05-21 — "source reliability has reasoning impact, not just portfolio decision impact. Reliable = green flag amplifier, unreliable = red flag discount or potentially contrarian signal."
  - Artifact: `research/meta/source-reliability.md` rewritten with 5-dimensional framework (tier + track record + bias direction + signal-use + best/worst use case)
  - Sources audited: SemiAnalysis, Aschenbrenner, WSJ/Bloomberg, Sherwood News (COI flag), TrendForce (memory-specific), Digitimes, Tom's Hardware, Benzinga, TradingKey, 24/7 Wall St, Motley Fool (transcripts only), BeyondSPX, WCCFTech
  - Monthly cadence item created for remaining 6 sources

- [x] **2026-05-21** [INFRA, INDP] — Date-aware SessionStart hook + recurring-audit-log + GitHub Action reminder
  - Origin: User request 2026-05-21 — "ensure the source-reliability monthly audit happens; remind me; update me if done while I'm away"
  - Artifacts: `~/.claude/session-start-hook.py` (date-aware elevation with markers) + `research/meta/recurring-audit-log.md` + `.github/workflows/recurring-audit-reminder.yml` + `.github/scripts/check-recurring-todos.py` + `research/meta/hooks/` mirror

  - Scope: re-run the 15-name AI-infrastructure basket subagent calibration (same names + Kioxia reference) for Jan/Feb 2026 → Sep 2026 window. Compute new band counts. If extreme-outlier count drops below 2 of 15 (vs current 6 of 15), regime priors weakened — update CLAUDE.md banner + priming hook item 8 to reflect new base rate.

- [x] **DONE 2026-06-26** — DURABLE HOOK ACTIVATION resolved via Architecture A (project-level `.claude/settings.json`), NOT laptop env-setup-script as originally planned. H1 test 2026-06-26 14:52:32Z confirmed Claude Code on Web reads `<repo-root>/.claude/settings.json` (diagnostic hook fired). Migration: all 16 research-OS hooks moved to `<repo>/.claude/settings.json` with absolute paths to `/home/user/Health-Calculators/research/meta/hooks/*.py`; `~/.claude/settings.json` emptied (backup at `~/.claude/settings.json.bak.pre-arch-a-2026-06-26`) to prevent merge duplication. Result: zero laptop dependency, zero install.sh dependency, zero ~/.claude/ dependency for hook persistence — settings ride with the repo via git clone. install.sh deprecated as primary activation; remains as emergency fallback. Full architecture rationale + verification protocol + migration history at `meta/hooks/DURABLE-ACTIVATION.md`. Falsifier: 2026-07-19 30-day audit checks `hook-fire-log.md` for fires on fresh-container sessions; if no fires, Architecture A failed and we fall back to install.sh + the original laptop-env-script approach.

- [x] **DONE 2026-06-26** — Activate session-prime-hook + macro-anchor-hook in mirror `research/meta/hooks/settings.json` (USER AUTHORIZED 2026-06-26 via "yes try it and test it"). Both hooks now wired in mirror + installed to `~/.claude/settings.json` via `install.sh`. Smoke-tested: session-prime-hook returns full `session-prime.md` as `additionalContext` on SessionStart events (exit 0); macro-anchor-hook fail-open on empty input (exit 0). DURABILITY caveat: persistence across container restarts still depends on P0 item directly above (install.sh as Web UI env setup script) — laptop required for that piece. Until then, run `bash research/meta/hooks/install.sh` at start of every fresh cloud container (or trigger via keyword pattern TBD). 2026-07-12 effectiveness audit unchanged.

- [x] **P2 / harness / 2026-06-24** [INFRA] — Session-prime curation rule integration into monthly audit
  - Origin: 2026-06-12 session-prime.md created with explicit cap rules (500-line hard / 250-400 target) — needs first monthly audit verification
  - Scope: at monthly codification audit (2026-06-24), verify session-prime.md (a) is ≤500 lines, (b) all listed CANDIDATE biases are still active (not gone INERT >30 days), (c) listed recent lessons are within rolling-5 window, (d) regime base rate not stale, (e) any codification commits since session-prime creation also updated session-prime

  - Scope: confirm whether AWS Trainium3 scale-up fabric socket goes to ALAB Scorpio or MRVL; if ALAB → entry trigger (a) fires, enter 2-3% per re-evaluation; if MRVL → demote ALAB watchlist P2→P3 + H3 (absorption squeeze) reweights up materially

  - Scope: (a) Was FY28 custom Si guide RAISED with named NEW XPU customer (Google MPU, new hyperscaler)? → confirms H1 bull; (b) Was guide reaffirmed with no new named customer? → base case dominant; (c) Was guide trimmed? → bear K2 fires → trim trigger; (d) Stock T+24h reaction vs L14/L14-v2 framework — calibration data point

  - Scope: at Jul-22 (30d post-inclusion), check MRVL stock action: down >15% AND no fundamental bear-news → L14 give-back pattern worse than expected → reweight Stage 3-4 modifier + trim trigger. Down <10% → K5 risk dissipated. Anywhere in between → monitoring

  - Origin: 2026-06-12 MRVL bear subagent — SPA exhibit not retrievable at T1; lock-up + standstill + exclusivity terms unverified; this drives MRVL falsifier #4
  - Scope: attempt EDGAR retrieval via alternate paths (10-Q/10-K reference exhibits, FOIA equivalents, redacted version in proxy materials); failing that, monitor for 13D/G or 8-K amendment exposing terms

- [x] **DONE 2026-06-12 PM** — Activate macro-anchor-hook in ~/.claude/settings.json — USER AUTHORIZED verbally ("I would activate it") 2026-06-12 20:11 UTC; registered as 14th Stop hook; verified via settings.json parse + sanity run exit 0. NOTE: session-prime-hook activation REMAINS PENDING (separate P0 item) — user's authorization was singular ("it") in macro-anchor context
  - Origin: 2026-06-12 user-articulated cross-session anchoring concern (every output should be macro-first research-anchored); Critical Rule #15 + B46 candidate codified same day; hook built + smoke-tested (fires on position-relevant without anchor; passes with macro/T1/tie-together marker)
  - Action: add `{"type":"command","command":"~/.claude/macro-anchor-hook.py"}` to Stop hooks array in ~/.claude/settings.json
  - Trade-off: more output friction (analytical responses must explicitly anchor to macro / tag claims / tie micro-to-macro); user explicitly accepted "slower replies, more accuracy" trade

June 4 cancellation anchor was CORRECT. HYNIX HBM thesis INTACT. B40.1 increment to N=10+. Closed in cross-source-log verification register. Discovery D2 (inference architecture bifurcation) ALSO COLLAPSES — no Rubin CPX = no prefill/decode chip-class split from NVDA side.

- [ ] **P2 / verification / 2026-07-13** [INDP] — Fable 5 / Mythos 5 access-restore check (H1 transient vs H2 structural resolver) — **re-dated 2026-07-06 (was 06-20, went 16d overdue unexecuted); still TC-10-live: by now the H1-transient window has long passed, so the check doubles as an H2-structural confirmation datapoint unless access was quietly restored**

H1 transient (P~45% my model) confirms if access restored allied-tier by ~June 20; if still disabled or a 2nd model-layer action appears, H2 structural-regime weight rises.

REMAINING: watch the EuroHPC gigafactory CALL ("summer 2026") — award winners = the next expression surface; deep-dig Schneider/Legrand DC-segment momentum before any tiering.
  - Origin: 2026-06-12 model-layer export-control signal (TC-10) — IF H2/H3 plays out, cleanest investable expression is EU-sovereign-AI serving infra; currently NO held or watchlist name captures it. Mistral is private (€3B raise 2026-06-12). Need investable proxies.
  - Scope: during the monthly supply-chain graph reconstruction cycle, fan out specifically on EU-sovereign-AI infra investable names (sovereign cloud, EU-compliant model serving, EU data-residency infra) that pass the investability filter (Degiro/N26 accessible). Surface 2-3 candidates if they exist.

  - Origin: 2026-06-13 AM brief item #15 — Republican congresspersons petition ITC to block TSMC chip imports via UMC patents (T2 Tom's Hardware). N=1 candidate cluster TC-11 (hardware-IP/patent enforcement at chip-import layer; distinct from TC-7 export-side).
  - Scope: 90-day watch for (a) ITC formal acceptance of Section 337 investigation (procedural milestone); (b) N=2 instance — any other hardware-IP enforcement action targeting AI chip flow; (c) hyperscaler/foundry public commentary
  - Outcome decision tree: ITC accepts + N=2 emerges → promote TC-11 CANDIDATE → ACTIVE → cascade to MRVL/NVDA watchlist + held MRVL thesis update; ITC declines OR no N=2 → keep candidate; close at 2026-09-13 monthly review

- [ ] **P1 / harness / 2026-08-06** [INFRA, CAL, OPT] — Two-bracket experiment EXTENDED close (normalized metric)
  - Origin: 30-day close ran 2026-07-06 (5d late, harness audit). Raw weekly fires 7→7→25→~23/wk-pace = literal INCREASE, but weeks 3-4 were the heaviest analytical-volume window on record → volume-confounded; pre-registered criteria couldn't cleanly adjudicate. **USER DECISION 2026-07-06: KEEP BOTH, extend 30 days.**
  - Scope: at 2026-08-06 compute the NORMALIZED metric — weekly structural-output fires ÷ weekly main-branch commits — for the full 2026-06-12→2026-08-06 span. Falling → priming works, keep both. Flat/rising → retire llm-native-priming-hook (structural-output-hook then stands on the ordinary <5 fires/month inert rule).
  - Cost context: priming injects ~10-15k tokens per UserPromptSubmit — the extension consciously accepts ~30 more days of that spend to buy a clean read.

  - Scope: per held name, scan competitor-product announcements weekly (1-2 hops to direct substitutes); output per-name competitive displacement risk Δ vs prior week
  - Cost: ~50-80k tokens/week for 7-name cohort = ~200-320k/month vs current monthly H2 bear-case (~280k); 4× cost vs monthly catches displacement 3-4 weeks earlier

- [ ] **P2 / harness / 2026-07-24** [INFRA, OPT, CAL] — LLM-native compression: N=3-per-variant ensemble replication + session-prime format-migration decision
  - Origin: 2026-07-12 pilot (`meta/experiments/2026-07-12-llm-native-compression-pilot.md`) — V1 telegraphic hit 12/12 at 27.6% of size; decision rule triggered
  - Scope: re-run probe battery with 3 readers per variant (fresh probes, second author-blind set if feasible); if replicated, rewrite session-prime.md in telegraphic form (keep human-skimmable) inside the 30k-char cap = ~3.6x state headroom; log two-audience constraint decision

- [ ] **P1 / research / 2026-07-14** [INDP, AF, OPT] — Newly-viable frontier PHASE 2: hunting-map sweep (Mode B candidate register)
  - Origin: user framework 2026-07-12 (`wiki/newly-viable-frontier.md`) — "what can LLM-native business models enable that previously wasn't possible or economically unviable"
  - Scope: multi-agent enumeration of cost structures w/ cognition >~50% COGS + latent demand at lower price points ("only the rich could afford X") + impossible-at-any-price primitives; run the viability-flip screen (pre-2023 labor prices) on each candidate; rank into a Mode-B candidate register; apply toy-detector + Griffin attribution filter; condition design on the historical base-rate agent's H1/H2/H3 verdict (if H3, add graveyard denominator)

  - Origin: user-designed 2026-07-12 night (`wiki/newly-viable-frontier.md` §6b) — demand-runway metric for compute/memory vs agentic adoption curve
  - Scope: define basket (Claude Code/Copilot/Cursor-class disclosed users; agent MAUs; API token volumes; enterprise seats); document per-component source+tier+date; compute first composite reading + honest uncertainty band; wire into end-demand-durability-model TVs; set monthly refresh

- [ ] **P2 / research / 2026-07-20** [INDP, AF] — Chokepoint-history study: ASML/TSMC precedent comparison
  - Origin: user question 2026-07-12 ("has there ever been that amount of chokepoint?")
  - Scope: historical chokepoints (Standard Oil, De Beers, Intel x86, Boeing/Airbus, others surfaced) vs ASML EUV/TSMC leading-edge on: capability-vs-supply control, replication time/cost, what happened to margins when substitutes arrived; deliverable = wiki entry + implications for TC-13/TC-16 chokepoint names
